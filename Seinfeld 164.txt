						(The final 'Castle Rock' screen shows, then the end credits roll. Scene cuts to the Coffee shop. George, Elaine, and Jerry enter with suitcases. Elaine has a large bandage on her nose. They all sit down at a booth. All three of them are tired, fed up, and angered)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: So, Elaine, are you going to sleep with me or what?!<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: (Aggravated) George, I just got off a twenty-three hour plane ride. I'm too tired to even vomit at the thought.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (Angered) Fine. I'll ask you again when you're rested.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (Sarcastic) Oh, I'm sure she'll come around.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Yeah, I hope so. For your sake!<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer comes in and sits down at the booth with them)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (To George) I said I was sorry.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: You can stuff you sorries in a sack, mister!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (Nauseated at the saying) Would you please stop saying that?!<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: (Confused) What is up with you two?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I don't want to talk about it.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: (To Jerry) So how was the big trip?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I don't want to talk about it!<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: (Observing Elaine's bandaged nose) Well, what happened to your nose?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I don't want to talk ab-ow!-t it! (She winces under the pain from her nose on the word 'about')<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Well, you gotta give me something! Come on, how was the wedding? Was the bride radiant?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: She.. was.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: 'Till she found out Elaine slept with the groom.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: (Interested) Ooohh... That sounds juicy. Listen, I gotta go to the bathroom, but I want to hear all about it. (Gets up and heads for the bathroom)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (While skimming a Monk's menu) You know, I didn't go to the bathroom the entire time we were in India.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I can't believe we went all the way to India for a wedding!<br>
							<br>

							<br>
							
						SUE ELLEN: That's it! The wedding's off.<br>
							<br>
							
						PINTER: What? But, Sue Ellen-<br>
							<br>
							
						SUE ELLEN: (Cutting him off. To Elaine) Elaine, you were my maid of honor and you slept with MY Pinter?!<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: No, no, no! It was years ago - before you met him. And, and I - I got to tell you.. it was very mechanical.<br>
							<br>
							
						SUE ELLEN: I have never been so humiliated!<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: (To Jerry and George) Idiots! This is all your fault!<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (While pointing at Jerry) Not me! Him! His fault! He betrayed me!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (Pleading) George, I'm sorry.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Oh you can stuff your sorries in a sack, Mister!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (Confused) I don't know what that means.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (To his girlfriend) Nina, you have to decide right now. Jerry or me?<br>
							<br>
							
						NINA: (Casually) Alright.. Neither.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: What?! Well, what are you doing here?<br>
							<br>
							
						NINA: A free trip to India. And by the way, you can take off those boots. Everyone knows you're five' six.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Five' eight! Five' seven!<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: (To Sue Ellen) See? See the way they are?! We're - we're still best friends, right?<br>
							<br>
							
						SUE ELLEN: No. (Grabbing at the stud in Elaine's nose) And take that stupid thing out of your nose!<br>
							<br>
							
						(Elaine screams in pain as Sue Ellen pulls the stud out)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: That's got to hurt, I don't care where you're from!<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (Whispering to Jerry) What time is our flight back? I got to go to the bathroom.<br>
							<br>

						(The bride, Sue Ellen, and the Groom, Pinter, are walking down the aisle. Elaine is scattering flowers behind them. Jerry walks in and takes a seat)<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: (Whispering to Jerry) Hey.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hey.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: What happened last night?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Oh, you were pretty loaded.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: (Gesturing to her nose stud) I know. I woke up with this.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Oh. Hello, Tetanus.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Scene cuts to Nina and George entering the wedding hall)<br>
							<br>
							
						NINA: George, I've used the bathroom. It's fine.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (Struggling) No, no, no, no. I can walk it off. It's a hundred and twenty degrees in here.. I'll sweat it out.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: (Seeing George, she walks over to greet him) Hey. (Looking at his shoes) Are those Timberlands ... painted black?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (Looking at her nose) Is your nose pierced?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: (Embarrassed) I should.. (Walks toward the bride and groom)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Yeah. (Points to two open seats in front of Jerry's. To Nina) Sit down there. (Sees Jerry in the crowd) Hello, Jerry. (Obviously angered at Jerry) I believe you know Nina.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (As George sits down) George, we need to talk.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (Trying to keep his voice down) I think you've done a lot more than talk! You betrayed me!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Alright, I admit it. I slept with Nina, but that's all.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (Outraged) &quot;That's all&quot;?! That's everything! I don't know what all the rest of it is for anyway!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (Pleading) I'm really sorry.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: You can stuff your sorries in a sack, mister!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (Confused) Where'd you get that one?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: It's an expression.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: (From the front of the room, she can hear George and Jerry's heated discussion) Hey! Shhhhh! (Crosses herself, then shakes her head - apologizing)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (Trying to whisper to Jerry) Look, we are gonna settle this right now! I demand reparations! I should get to sleep with Elaine. That's the only way to punish you!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: That doesn't punish me. It punishes Elaine! And cruelly, I might add.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (Losing it) Funny guy!<br>
							<br>
							
						(Elaine quickly makes her way to Jerry and George, scattering flower petals as she goes -- she throws some at them)<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Hey! Monkeys! Knock it off. My best friend is trying to get married up here!<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Elaine, you have to sleep with me.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: (Definite) I'm not gonna sleep with you.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Reparations!<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Would you grow up, George?! What is the difference? Nina slept with him (Points to Jerry), he slept with me, I slept with Pinter. Nobody cares! It's all ancient history.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (Loud, so everyone at the wedding can hear) You slept with the groom?!<br>
							<br>
							
						(Everyone goes silent. George and Elaine both look sheepishly. All eyes on them, especially Sue Ellen)<br>

							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Oh, thank you, FDR! All right, now we&#146;re even.<br>

							<br>
							
						FDR: Alright.<br>
							<br>
							
						(They each pull, it breaks. FDR won)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Oh, man! All right, come on. There's got to be something that'll change your mind, FDR. Something..&quot; (FDR lifts up a cooler, and puts it on the table) What, you want my kidney? (FDR is smiling wickedly as he pulls a snowball out of the cooler) Mama!..<br>

							<br>
							
						ELAINE: He schnapped me.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You know you're not supposed to drink while you're keeping a secret! (Elaine laughs) Is there anything else?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I can't tell you.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (Handing her a small bottle) Here, drink this.<br>

							<br>
							
						(Elaine climbs on to the sofa-- on her knees, head into the side of the couch cushion, her butt in the air towards Jerry)<br>
							<br>

						ELAINE: Do you know what 'Jerry' is in Indian?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (Carrying her out, piggy-back style) No, what?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: (Between laughs) Jugdish.<br>

							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Hey, what if I got my, nose pierced? That would be pretty freaky.. Oooohhhhaaa! (sliding off Jerry onto the hallway floor)<br>

							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Well, guess what, FDR? I made a wish on a shooting star last night, and I wished, against your wish.<br>
							<br>
							
						FDR: That's funny. As it happens, I saw the same shooting star and double-wished you, to drop dead. (clicks out some coins from his changer and hands them to Kramer) Here's your change.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer walks over, and throws his coins in a nearby fountain)<br>

						Just a side note -- &#147;Sorry&#148; vs &#147;Sari&#148; or &#147;Saree&#148;<br>
							<br>
							
						The expression &quot;You can stuff your sorries in a sack&quot; is used throughout this episode (mainly by George, but also by Susan -- obviously Susan means it as &quot;sorry's&quot; -- You can stuff your sorry's in a sack&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						Since the episode also revolves around the trip to India, perhaps the writers of the episode are using the word &#147;Sorry&#148; and the Indian term &#147;Sari&#148; or &#147;Saree&#148; in a play on words -- A pun perhaps<br>
							<br>
							
						The definition of &#147;Sari&#148; or &#147;Saree&#148; is:<br>
							
						Sari / Saree: A long piece of cotton or silk cloth, constituting the principal garment of Hindu women, worn round the waist, one end falling to the feet, and the other crossed over the bosom and shoulder, and sometimes over the head.<br>
							<br>
							
						As they are in India, this would make sense, because you could literally &quot;stuff your Sarees in a sack&quot; -- so it is a play on words. Otherwise George would be saying &quot;You can stuff your &#147;Sorry's&#148; in a sack&quot; Like you have a sack stuffed full of &quot;apologys.&quot;<br>
