[Exterior of Monk's coffee shop. Cut to Jerry and George at their regular booth.]

(A newspaper blocks out view of George's face. He lowers the paper to reveal... a moustache.)

GEORGE: What is Holland?

JERRY: (also wearing a moustache) What do you mean, 'what is it?' It's a country right next to Belgium.
 
GEORGE: No, that's the Netherlands.

JERRY: Holland *is* the Netherlands.

GEORGE: Then who are the Dutch?

JERRY: (picking at his moustache) You know I cannot stand this thing anymore.

GEORGE: I know, I hate it too. I feel like an out of work porn star.

JERRY: I told you, we should have taken some kind of vacation.

GEORGE: Well why didn't we?

JERRY: Because you said this would be better. Remember? A vacation from ourselves. That's what you said.

GEORGE: What if we grew muttonchops?

JERRY: No.

GEORGE: Buzz cuts? Parachute pants!

JERRY: Stop it, George. Stop it. I'm sorry, you've gotta get a job.

GEORGE: (resigned) Dammit.


[George approaches Jerry at the bar of a nightclub, carrying a cane.]

GEORGE: Hey hey hey, check me out, huh?

JERRY: No more crutches, that must be a relief.

GEORGE: Yeah, with crutches everyone has questions.

JERRY: Not with a cane?

GEORGE: Nah, with crutches it's a funny story, with a cane it's a sad story. You through with those?

(George uses the cane handle to drag a bowl of pretzels over from the other end of the bar.)

JERRY: That is a sad story. Hey, you should have been here tonight. Some guy from NBC saw my set, he wants me to do a showcase. I might have another shot at a pilot.

GEORGE: Alright, we're back in!

JERRY: We? No.

CLUB ANNOUNCER: (off camera) Ladies and gentlemen, Kenny Bania.

(Applause from off camera, then Bania walks up to the bar.)

BANIA: Thank you, thank you, (To Jerry) Hey, Jerry, did ya see me up there? I was killing, Jerry. Killing. I killed.

JERRY: Killed?

BANIA: Killed. (pause) I'm gonna go pick up some chicks. Good-looking ones, too! (walking away) Hey, what's your name?

JERRY: Yeah, killed. Because I killed first and warmed up the crowd. He's like that fish that attaches himself to the shark.

GEORGE: And you're the shark?

JERRY: Yeah, I'm the shark and he's the fish eating my laughs.

GEORGE: I don't know how a fish could eat laughs.

JERRY: Well, I'm glad I brought it up.


[Jerry's apartment. George and Jerry are there, clean shaven, George is on the phone. Kramer walks in wearing a moustache.]

KRAMER: You got any shredded coconut?

JERRY: (looking at Kramer's moustache) Uh, we're not doing that anymore.

KRAMER: Yeah, yeah, right. (walks out)

GEORGE: (on the phone) Oh my God.

JERRY: What?

GEORGE: I got a job interview. They want to see me this afternoon.

JERRY: So what's this job?

GEORGE: Oh, it's beautiful. It's in sports.

JERRY: Knicks? Rangers?

GEORGE: Playground equipment.

JERRY: Welcome back to the show.

GEORGE: Yeah haha.

(Kramer walks back in, clean shaven.)

KRAMER: Yeah, this is better. So, you got any shredded coconut?

JERRY: No.

GEORGE: (holding his cane) I gotta hobble. (walks out)

(Kramer puts some aftershave on his lip.)

KRAMER: D-d-d-d. I gotta switch shaving creams. I'm getting no protection.

JERRY: What kind do you use?

KRAMER: Whatever you get.

JERRY: (nods) Look, postcard from Elaine from Europe.

KRAMER: Don't tell me she's dragging another poor guy across Europe.

JERRY: Remember David Puddy?

KRAMER: Oh, the face-painting auto mechanic. So she's dating him again, huh?

JERRY: Well, I guess she's batted around and she's back at the top of the order.

KRAMER: Boy, a month in Europe with Elaine. (whistles) That guy's coming home in a body bag.


[Atlas map of Scandinavia with Oslo, Norway highlighted. Cut to Elaine and Puddy in the back seat of a taxi.]

PUDDY: Well, let's see, I've got a ten kroner, a five kroner, a twenty kroner? No wait, that's another ten kroner. A fimty kroner? How much is that?

ELAINE: We have to break up.

PUDDY: What?

ELAINE: I can't take this anymore! I don't want to hear how interesting the change with the hole in it is! And if you tell me what time it is in New York again, you are going home in a body bag!

PUDDY: Well what about you? What do you think The Gap in Rome has that's not in The Gap on Broadway?

ELAINE: Okay, alright listen. Forget about The Gap because we are through!

PUDDY: Fine!

ELAINE: Fine!

CAB DRIVER: Okay, terminal three. Have a nice flight.


[Interior of an airplane. Elaine and Puddy are seated together. Puddy is crying]

CAPTAIN: Ladies and gentlemen, our flight time, with stopovers, will be approximately 22 hours.

ELAINE: (to flight attendant) Hey, you gonna bust out that drink cart or what?


[Jerry's apartment. Kramer and Jerry are there.]

KRAMER: Hey, what are you doing?

JERRY: Oh, I'm taking this lace out. It came undone and touched the floor of a men's room. That's
