[Opening Monologue]

JERRY: The old-fashioned barber shop is unfortunately becoming a thing of the past, now what went wrong? Well first of all there's a twenty thousand dollar chair to make a three dollar tip. I say cut back on the chair, update the magazines. Why do barbers always display that license? There's no laws in hair cutting, except show every person the back of their head that's the one law. I don't want to see the back of my head. Why do I want to see something that I'm never going to see at any other time? When I buy pants two salesmen don't lift me up by the legs and go &quot;how do you like crotch?&quot; If I wanted to see everything I would have been a fly.

(George is at a meeting)

MR. TUTTLE: Well George we here at Sanalac like to think of ourselves as a fairly progressive company. We have a small but prestigious group of clients. 

GEORGE: Well a lot of people consider me small and prestigious. 

MR. TUTTLE: That's funny George. You're very quick. I feel like I, like I don't have to explain every little thing to you. You understand everything immediately. 

GEORGE: I enjoy understanding. 

MR. TUTTLE: I want you to have this job. Of course... 

SECRETARY: Mr. Zimmer is on line 2. 

MR. TUTTLE: Thanks. I've got to take this call. Listen, I'm really glad that you came in.

JERRY &amp; ELAINE: Yeah? 

GEORGE: That's it. 

JERRY: What do you mean that's it? 

GEORGE: He never finished the sentence. He got a call, that was
