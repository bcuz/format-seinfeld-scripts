[Kramer and Newman at the park, smoking cigars]

KRAMER: Well, I really miss the Bermuda Triangle.

NEWMAN: I guess there's not much action down there these days.

KRAMER: Oh, there's action. There's plenty of action. That damned alien autopsy is stealing all the headlines.

NEWMAN: Yeah, tell me about it.

KRAMER: See, what they gotta do is loose a plane or a Greenpeace boat in there. See, that would get the triangle going again.

NEWMAN: What keeps the water in there? I mean, why doesn't it disappear?

KRAMER: What would be the point in taking the water?

NEWMAN: It's gorgeous water. (pause) Do we own Bermuda?

KRAMER: No. It belongs to the British.

NEWMAN: Lucky krauts.

KRAMER: So, what do you think about that alien autopsy?

NEWMAN: Oh, that's real.

KRAMER: I think so too.


<font size="-2">[Elaine at the doctor's]

ATTENDANT: The doctor will be with you in a moment. 

(Elaine looking at her chart) 

ELAINE: Difficult? 

DOCTOR: Elaine. You shouldn't be reading that. So tell me about this rash of yours. 

ELAINE: Well it's, it's..... You know I noticed that somebody wrote in my chart that I was difficult in January of 92 and I have to tell you that I remember that appointment exactly. You see this nurse asked me to put a gown on but it was a mole on my shoulder and I specifically wore a tank top so I wouldn't have to put a gown on. You know there made of paper. 

DOCTOR: Well that was a long time ago. How about if I just erase it. Now about that rash...... 

ELAINE: But it was in pen. You fake erase. 

DOCTOR: All right Miss Benes. This doesn't look to serious. You'll be fine.

ELAINE: What are you writing? Doctor. 


[George at Photo Shop] 

SHEILA: Here you go. 

GEORGE: Thanks. 

SHEILA: I hope you got that mustard stain out of your shirt. 

GEORGE: Ohhhhhh 


[Jerry, Kramer, and George at the apartment] 

JERRY: No. All you got to do is jiggle it with this screwdriver. 

GEORGE: Smile 

JERRY: What are you doing? 

GEORGE: I meet this women, Sheila. She works down at the one hour photo pace. She's got this incredible smile. Like she's got extra teeth or something 

JERRY: Extra teeth. I love that look. 

GEORGE: Hey check this out. I go to pick up my pictures and she says " I hope you got that mustard stain out of your shirt." 

JERRY: What mustard stain? 

GEORGE: Don't you see. She's looking at my pictures. 

JERRY: Why did you take a picture of a mustard stain? 

GEORGE: That's got nothing to do with it. 

JERRY: I see. She's looking. 

GEORGE: Yesssss. 

KRAMER: Hey, you got to get this thing fixed. 

JERRY: They've tried to fix it. But it keeps coming back the same. 

KRAMER: Would you like a refund? 

JERRY: Well I can't the warranty expired two years ago. 

KRAMER: Would you be interested? 

JERRY: Well how are you going..... 

KRAMER: Would you? 

JERRY: I guess I would. 

KRAMER: Yeah, yeah. 

(Elaine walks in) 

ELAINE: You are not going to believe what happened to me at the doctors office today. 

JERRY: Not the gown again. 

ELAINE: No, no. I was looking at my chart and it said I was difficult. Why would they write that? 

JERRY: They have gotten to know you. 

(Kramer leaves with Jerry's stereo) 

ELAINE: Then the doctor writes more stuff down and doesn't even look at my rash. 

GEORGE: Why don't you find a doctor that doesn't know your difficult. 

ELAINE: Oh come on. I'm not difficult. I'm easy. 

JERRY: Why because you dress casual and sleep with a lot of guys. 

ELAINE: Listen to me you little shi........ 

GEORGE: Smile. 


[Elaine at another doctor's office] 

DOCTOR: Well Elaine you really didn't have to put on the gown. 

ELAINE: Oh it's my pleasure. I love these. In fact I got one at home. It's perfect when you just want to throw something on. 

(Nurse hands the doctor her chart) 

DOCTOR: All rightly. Let me just review your history before we begin. 

ELAINE: Where did you get my chart? 

DOCTOR: From your last doctor. It's a standard procedure. 

ELAINE: You know I can tell you my whole history. Let's just....... 

DOCTOR: Okay. Let's take a look. Well that doesn't look to serious. You'll be fine. 

ELAINE: Please, please. It's really, really itchy. 

(Doctor writes more stuff in her chart) 


[Jerry at apartment] 

(Knock, knock)

POSTAL WORKER DANNY: Seinfeld? 

JERRY: Yeah. 

POSTAL WORKER DANNY: I got a package for you. Sign here. 

JERRY: Who's it from? 

POSTAL WORKER DANNY: No return address. 

JERRY: What if I don't want it? 

POSTAL WORKER: Are you refusing delivery? 

JERRY: Maybe I am. 

POSTAL WORKER DANNY: Why would you do that? 

JERRY: I've never done it before. 

POSTAL WORKER DANNY: Why start now? 

JERRY: Why not? 

POSTAL WORKER DANNY: All right. 

(George walks in) 

GEORGE: Why did you refuse the package. Everybody loves a package. 

JERRY: I don't know it was weird. Crazy printing. I don't know who it was from. 

GEORGE: What do you think it's a bomb? 

JERRY: It's not totally impossible. 

GEORGE: Oh the ego on you. 

JERRY: Why can't I be bombable? 

GEORGE: Who's going to bomb you. An airline for all the stupid little peanut jokes. 

JERRY: I suppose you think your bombable. 

GEORGE: Hey. There is a couple of people that wouldn't mind having me out of the way. 

JERRY: There's more than a couple. 

GEORGE: Hey. Check these out. I just picked them up from Sheila. She must have loved these. 

JERRY: You don't have a Mercedes. 

GEORGE: I know. I just sort of leaned on it so it would look like it was mine. 

JERRY: The driver seems a little put out. 

GEORGE: No. He was fine with it. Check that out. 

JERRY: Is that Burt Reynolds? 

GEORGE: Wax Museum. 

JERRY: Oh. 

GEORGE: Oh. What is this? 

JERRY: That's a lot of skin. 

GEORGE: This must be Sheila from the photo place. 

JERRY: You can barely see her face. 

GEORGE: She must have slipped it in here. 

(Kramer walks in) 

KRAMER: I I I 

GEORGE: Photo store Sheila. 

KRAMER: Well hello Photo store Sheila. 

GEORGE: All right. I will see you boys later. 

JERRY: Where are you going? 

GEORGE: To ask her out. 

KRAMER: No, no. Your not playing the game. 

GEORGE: What game? 

KRAMER: She goes to these lengths to entice you and your only response is " Gee I really like your picture. Would you like to go out on a date with me please. " 

GEORGE: No good? 

KRAMER: George. It's the timeless art of seduction. You got to join in the dance. She sends you an enticing photo, you send her one right back. 

GEORGE: Oh, I don't know. 

KRAMER: Well as you know I've always been something of a photog. 

JERRY: Oh yeah I like this idea. 


[Outside Uncle Leo's apartment] 

UNCLE LEO: Hey Danny. Hello. How are you? 

POSTAL WORKER DANNY: Hey Leo. Leo what's up with your nephew. He wouldn't except his package. 

UNCLE LEO: Oh He wants it. He's just trying to be funny. Yeah I'll sign it .


[George and Elaine in taxi] 

ELAINE: And then he starts writing on my chart. 

GEORGE: Well why don't you get a hold of it and change what you don't like. 

ELAINE: You can't change your chart. It's your chart. 

GEORGE: I am in and out of my personnel file at work all the time. 

ELAINE: You are!?! 

GEORGE: Hey. I've kept the same job for more than two years. It's not luck. Elaine, have you ever sent a racy photograph of yourself to anyone? 

ELAINE: Yeah. I sent one to everyone I know. Remember my Christmas card. 

GEORGE: Oh yeah the nipple. But besides that. How did you feel about Kramer's work? 

ELAINE: Actually I thought he was very professional. 

GEORGE: So it was a good experience. 

ELAINE: Oh yeah. In fact I like the picture so much I cropped out the nipple and am using as my health club ID. 

GEORGE: Nice. 

ELAINE: Yeah it is nice actually. 


[Elaine at another doctors] 

ELAINE: I need to see Dr. Burke right away. This rash is spreading. 

ATTENDANT: He can't see you Miss Benes, he's busy. 

ELAINE: Oh come on. Have some compassion. Okay well I hope it's contagious 

(Elaine rubs the attendants phone on her neck. Soon after Elaine finds her chart and runs to the elevator) 

ELAINE: Come on. Move. (elevator doors reopen; Dr. Burke and two orderlies are revealed) Oh hi Dr. Burke. I didn't know if uh.... 

DR. BURKE: The chart Miss Benes. 

(The doctor writes more stuff in it) 

ELAINE: Oh please no more. 


[Jerry at his apartment] 

(George walks in) 

JERRY: Hey 

GEORGE: Where's Kramer?

GEORGE: Personal matter. 

(Phone rings) 

JERRY: Hello 

UNCLE LEO: Jerry! It's your Uncle Leo! Hello! 

JERRY: Hello Leo. You don't have to yell. 

UNCLE LEO: I got your package. 

JERRY: How did you get my package? 

UNCLE LEO: What should I do with it? 

JERRY: I don't know what you should do with it. 

GEORGE: Tell him to open it. 

JERRY: I am not going to treat my uncle like a bomb defusing robot. 

UNCLE LEO: Jerry, Your cousin Jeffrey is in the Parks Production of "The Mikado". I want you to go see it with me. 

JERRY: Open the package Leo. 

UNCLE LEO: Okay. Opening. 

JERRY: Opening. 

(Through the phone: BOOM!!!)


[Jerry's apartment later that day; Jerry and Elaine] 

ELAINE: So it wasn't a bomb. 

JERRY: No, No bomb. 

ELAINE: Well then what? 

JERRY: Oh stupid Leo was using one of those oven cleaners. He left the canister in there and the pilot light was on. The whole thing blew up. 

ELAINE: But he's okay? 

JERRY: Yeah but the explosion singed off his eyebrows, mustache everything. He's all smooth now. Look's like a seal. 

(Elaine on phone) 

ELAINE: Yeah I am still holding. 

(Jerry opens his package) 

JERRY: Is this my stereo? 

(Kramer walks in) 

KRAMER: Hey you got it. 

JERRY: What happened to my stereo? It's all smashed up. 

KRAMER: That's right. Now it looks like it was broken during shipping and I insured it for $400. 

JERRY: But you were supposed to get me a refund. 

KRAMER: You can't get a refund. Your warranty expired two years ago. 

JERRY: So were going to make the Post Office pay for my new stereo? 

KRAMER: It's just a write off for them. 

JERRY: How is it a write off? 

KRAMER: They just write it off. 

JERRY: Write it off what? 

KRAMER: Jerry all these big companies they write off everything 

JERRY: You don't even know what a write off is. 

KRAMER: Do you? 

JERRY: No. I don't. 

KRAMER: But they do and they are the ones writing it off. 

JERRY: I wish I just had the last twenty seconds of my life back. 

(Elaine still on phone) 

ELAINE: What?!? He doesn't have one appointment this whole month!?! Oh come on. I am dying here man. Hello, hello. 

JERRY: Still no luck 

(Kramer leaves with a fan) 

ELAINE: Jerry I am at doctor Zimmerman. I am at the end of the alphabet. 

JERRY: There's no Zorn or Zoutraph. 

ELAINE: There on vacation. Every doctor in this city seems to know who I am .

JERRY: Hey what about Dr. Resnick My Uncle Leo is going to see him tomorrow .

ELAINE: Dr. Resnick. He's not listed. 

JERRY: He's not that good. 

Kramer and George at Kramer's apartment 

GEORGE: Elaine said your pretty good at this stuff. 

KRAMER: Oh yeah. Elaine was a fun project. I enjoyed working with her. 

GEORGE: You don't have your own camera.

ATTENDANT: I am sorry. It looks like the claim has been red flagged. Your under investigation. 

JERRY: Investigation? 

NEWMAN: Hello Jerry. 

JERRY: Hello Newman. 

NEWMAN: Kramer you might as well run along. Jerry might be a while. Suspicion of mail fraud. 

KRAMER: Mail fraud. Your in a lot of trouble buddy. 


[Uncle Leo at Dr. Resnick's office]

DR. RESNICK: I got your ointment. Where's your nurse? 

UNCLE LEO: She left. 

DR. RESNICK: No need to get angry. Calm down. 

UNCLE LEO: I am calm. 

DR. RESNICK: Leo I don't care for your demeanor. 

UNCLE LEO: Demeanor? 

DR. RESNICK: Now your just being difficult. 

UNCLE LEO: What are you writing?

SHEILA: Hey Ron I got to go to lunch. Can you do a roll? 

RON: No problem. 

SHEILA: By the way. You know that model that is always in here. She's missing one of her lingerie shots. Have you seen it? 

RON: No. 


[Jerry and Newman at the Post Office] 

NEWMAN: All right. Then let me ask you this. Didn't you find it interesting that your friend had the foresight to purchase postal insurance for your stereo. Huh. I mean parcels are rarely damaged during shipping. 

JERRY: Define rarely. 

NEWMAN: Frequently. 

JERRY: Are we about throw here Newman? 

NEWMAN: It's pretty hot under these lights huh Seinfeld. Pretty....... Hot .

JERRY: Actually I am quite comfortable. 

NEWMAN: Can I have a sip? 

JERRY: No. 

NEWMAN: Not going to play ball. Huh all right. Admit it that stereo was all ready busted. 

JERRY: You can't prove anything. 

NEWMAN: Is this or is this not your signature? 

JERRY: No in a matter of fact it isn't. 

NEWMAN: Uncle Leo? This case is closed pending further evidence. Jerry. 


[Kramer and Elaine at doctor's]

[Newman walking down the street] 

NEWMAN: Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry.


[Kramer at doctor's] 

KRAMER: I like what you've done with that. 

ATTENDANT: May I help you? 

KRAMER: Yes, yes. I am Dr. Vanostran from the clinic. I need Elaine Benes chart. She's a patient of mine and she's not going to make it. It's uh very bad very messy. 

ATTENDANT: I see and what clinic is that again? 

KRAMER: That's correct. 

ATTENDANT: Excuse me. 

KRAMER: From The Hoffer-Mandale Clinic in Belgium. 

ATTENDANT: Really? 

KRAMER: The Netherlands? 

ELAINE: Where's my chart? Did you get it? 

KRAMER: No. 

ELAINE: What? What happened? 

KRAMER: I don't know. But now they got a chart on me. 


[George at photo store] 

SHEILA: I don't know where they could be. 

GEORGE: Can't find them. That's marvelous. The dance continues. 

SHEILA: Well if I find them I'll call you. 

GEORGE: And maybe we could go out and do something. 

SHEILA: Sure. 

RON: Hello. 

GEORGE: Hi. 

(George leaves) 

SHEILA: So the little guy finally asked me out. 

RON: Really? 

SHEILA: Hey I can't find his photo's anywhere. 

RON: Oh you know what happened. Some guy from the Post Office confiscated them. He left his card. 

SHEILA: Newman? 


[George and Jerry at Post Office] 

GEORGE: I don't know what Newman wanted to see me for. 

NEWMAN: Gentlemen, gentlemen. I am so happy to see you both. There is just some inconsistencies I'd like to straighten out. 

JERRY: I'm clean and you know it. 

NEWMAN: Clean? Hardly. This looks like a man that isn't happy with his stereo performance. 

JERRY: Where did you get that? 

GEORGE: I think that's one of mine. 

NEWMAN: It looks like your breaking into it like an otter breaking into a clad. 

JERRY: I don't know about that but I'm sure there is a explanation. 

NEWMAN: Yes. It's called mail fraud. Oohhhh. How I've longed for this moment Seinfeld. The day when I would have the proof I needed to hall you out of your cushy lair and expose to the light of justice as the monster that you are. A monster so vile..... 

GUY: NEWMAN!! 

NEWMAN: There will be a small fine. 

JERRY: Okay. 

GEORGE: Can we go now? 

NEWMAN: Not so fast pretty boy. There is more to this sorted little affair. 

JERRY: Oh my god!! 

NEWMAN: This photo clearly indicates your involvement in some ill-conceived mail order pornography ring.As does this one found in the same disturbing packet. 

(Newman holds up a picture of Ron) 

GEORGE: OH MY GOD!!! 

NEWMAN: We have some questions we'd like you to answer. 

JERRY: I have some questions of my own. 

(Sheila walks in) 

SHEILA: Hi. One of your mailmen....... Oh my god, George!?! 

GEORGE: Listen Sheila it's not what you think. I put my trust into the wrong person. He said the key word was tasteful. 

JERRY: The timeless art of seduction. 

GEORGE: SHEILA!!!
