[OPENING MONOLOGUE]

The idea behind the tuxedo is the woman's point of view that men are all the same, so we might as well dress them that way. That's why a wedding is like the joining together of a beautiful glowing bride, and some guy. The tuxedo is a wedding safety device created by women because they know that men are undependable. So in case the groom chickens out, everybody just takes one step over and she marries the next guy. That?s why the wedding vow isn't 'do you take Bill Simpson', its 'do you take this man'.


[INSIDE JOE DIVOLA'S APARTMENT]

JERRY: (answering machine) leave a message and I?ll call you back, thanks. JOE DIVOLA: Jerry, Joe Divola. *Pbt* *Pbt* *Pbt* I have a hair on my tongue, I can't get it off, you know how much I hate that? Course you do, you put it there. I know what you said about me Seinfeld. I know you badmouthed me to the execs at NBC, put the kibosh on my deal. Now I?m gonna put the kibosh on you. You know I?ve kiboshed before, and I will kibosh again.


[JERRY'S APARTMENT.]

(Kramer and Jerry enter)

KRAMER: So, what do you think?

JERRY: About what?

KRAMER: About the opera.

JERRY: Nah, I don't wanna go.

KRAMER: You gotta go.

JERRY: I-I-I don't like the opera. What are they singing for? Who sings? You got something to say, say it!

KRAMER: Jerry, you don't understand, that?s the way they talk in Italy, they sing to one another. Kramer starts to sing in bad Italian.

JERRY: All right, all right.

KRAMER: That?s the way it was, you know. You listen to the language, its got that sing songy quality. It?s the language Jerry, the language

JERRY: So why don't they talk like that now?

KRAMER: Well its, uh, well its too hard to keep up, you know, they were tired.

(BUZZER)

KRAMER: Better get that

JERRY: Yeah?

ELAINE: (intercom) it?s me!

JERRY: Come on up.

KRAMER: So, huh?

JERRY: I don't know

KRAMER: Oh come on Jerry, its opening night, black tie, Pagliacci! The great clown, the great sad tragic clown, like you.

JERRY: Well it?s very flattering. How did you get these tickets, I heard they're impossible to get.

KRAMER: Oh, well I have many associates.

JERRY: I don't know, opera, it?s not my kind of thing.

KRAMER: All right, you not gonna go I?m not gonna go, I?m gonna call the whole thing off.

JERRY: No, wait a minute, wait a minute, that?s not fair, what about George, Susan and Elaine, what do you need me for?

KRAMER: You're the nucleus, the straw that stirs the drink. You're the Miana!

JERRY: Well I guess if I?m the Miana I should go. All right, all right.

(ELAINE ENTERS)

ELAINE: Hi!

JERRY: Hi!

KRAMER: Hey! Hi Elaine!

ELAINE: You got the tickets right?

KRAMER: Well no, I don't have them on me.

ELAINE: What? That?s why I came all the way over here.

KRAMER: My friends got 'em, I?m going to pick them up tomorrow.

ELAINE: Oh, I was gonna surprise Joey with them, you got an extra one right?

KRAMER: Oh yeah!

JERRY: So I finally get to meet your pal Joey.

ELAINE: Its killing you isn?t it?

JERRY: Yeah, so Joey?s a great lover of the opera

ELAINE: Listen, I got news for ya, its nice to be involved with somebody who?s interested in something other than nick at night. Now he?s got a grip on reality, he's happy, he's well adjusted.


[JOE DIVOLA'S APARTMENT]

(Opera music playing (Paliachi?) Divola is crying while lifting weights. Photos of Elaine are scattered on the floor.)


[JERRY'S APARTMENT]

JERRY: Well I?m looking forward to meeting him.

ELAINE: I've got to go

JERRY: Where are you going, what?s the rush?

ELAINE: I'm going to surprise Joey, I?ve never been to his apartment so I?m just going to 'pop in'

JERRY: Oh, good, men love that!

(Kramer is reading Jerry's mail under the lamp.)

JERRY: Hey!

KRAMER: You've got a message buddy.

JERRY: Ooo, could be from that blonde

KRAMER: Oo yiggity diggigg

JOE DIVOLA: (answering machine message)'Jerry, Joe Divola. I have a hair on my tongue'


[JOE DIVOLA'S APARTMENT]

(Divola has his hand over a candle and is laughing)


[JERRY'S APARTMENT]

JERRY: (shouting) Kramer what am I going to do did you hear that that guy's gonna put a kibosh on me he's crazy he's out of his mind....

KRAMER: Steady, steady, now calm yourself, come on, now get a hold of yourself,

JERRY: What the hell he's supposed to be on medication I don't understand he told me he's getting medication what happened to his medication!?

KRAMER: OK Quiet! Quiet! Now let me think!

JERRY: I'm gonna call the cops. That?s what I?m doing, I?m calling the cops.

KRAMER: The cops? What are you calling the cops for? They?re not going to do anything!

JERRY: What do you mean they're not going to do anything, they're the cops, they gotta do something, he just put the kibosh on me, do you know what the kibosh means, its a kibosh!

KRAMER: Yiddigtkk ka kibosh.

JERRY: I mean it's a terrible mistake, I mean he thinks I ruined some deal of his at NBC, I don't know anything about any deal at NBC.

KRAMER: Call him and tell him

JERRY: That?s what I?ll do, I?ll just call him and tell him, I?ll tell him. That?s all I?ll do. He's a human being, I?ll talk to him. He'll understand. Right?

KRAMER: Right.... Don't mention my name

JERRY: Oh, I got the machine.

KRAMER: What?s his message like?

JERRY: Nice!

KRAMER: Eh!

JERRY: (into phone) Hello Joe, listen this is Jerry Seinfeld, I really think there?s been a huge colossal misunderstanding,

KRAMER: Big! Big!

JERRY: and I feel if we can just talk about this we can straighten the whole thing out, so listen, so call me back. Bye.


[JOE DIVOLA'S APARTMENT]

(The door is open. Elaine knocks and then enters)

ELAINE: Joey? Joey?

(She sees a wall covered in photos of her. Joe Divola enters and shuts the front door.)

ELAINE: Oh god, oh, its you! You scared me!

JOE DIVOLA: Good. Fear is our most primal emotion.

ELAINE: You left your door open.

JOE DIVOLA: I know, I like to encourage intruders.

ELAINE: (laughs) What?s all this?

JOE DIVOLA: Do you like it? My home is a shrine to you.

ELAINE: Where did you get all these pictures?

JOE DIVOLA: I took them myself with a telephoto lens. Coming out of your office, your apartment, shopping, showering.

ELAINE: Showering?

JOE DIVOLA: I developed them myself in my dark room. Would you like to see?

ELAINE: In the dark room? Uh no, no thank you. Not right now. I'm a day person!... Are you all right?

JOE DIVOLA: Why

ELAINE: Well I don't know, you just don't seem yourself?

JOE DIVOLA: Who am I? Who am I supposed to be?

ELAINE: That?s a good question, good question, its very... exerstential! Who are you? Who am I? Yeah, well.

JOE DIVOLA: What are you doing here?

ELAINE: Oh, nothing, I just stopped by to chat, you know, shoot the breeze.

JOE DIVOLA: Were you able to get those opera tickets to Pagliacci from that friend of yours? I'm really looking forward to it.

ELAINE: Oh, no, he couldn't get them. We're not going.

JOE DIVOLA: Really?

ELAINE: Oh, dammit, you know I just remembered I gotta go, I left something on, the gas, the lights, the water in the tub. Something is on somewhere so I?m just gonna get the uh..

(Divola is blocking the door with his head.)

JOE DIVOLA: You know the story of Pagliacci, Nedda?

ELAINE: Uh.. I?m Elaine!

JOE DIVOLA: He's a clown whose wife is unfaithful to him.

ELAINE: Oh.

JOE DIVOLA: Do you think I?m a clown, Nedda?

ELAINE: Do I think you're a clown? No, not if it?s bad to be a clown, if it?s bad to be a clown then you are definitely not a clown. But if its good to be a clown then, you know, I would have to rethink the whole thing.

JOE DIVOLA: You've betrayed me with another, haven't you, Nedda? Who is he. I want you to tell me who he is. I want his name. Tell me his name.

ELAINE: Oh, like any man would ever look at me, come on, I?m gonna... get out of here.

(Divola blocks the door when Elaine tries to leave.)

JOE DIVOLA: Pagliacci kills his wife.

ELAINE: Se, now that?s terrible, that is not a nice thing to do at all, I don?t know how this Paliachi thing turns out but you know I would assume that there is big big trouble for that clown

JOE DIVOLA: You're not leaving

(Elaine sprays Divola in the eyes and he falls on his back. Elaine leaves.)


[JERRY'S APARTMENT.]

JERRY: (on phone) But officer, he threatened me! I don't understand, that?s not right! What if it was the President of the United States I bet you'd investigate. So what?s the difference, I?m a comedian of the United States, and I?ll tell you I?m under just as much pressure. Alright, thanks anyway, ok bye.

(Knock at door.)

JERRY: (cautiously) Who is it?

GEORGE: It's George.

(George enters wearing a very small tuxedo.)

GEORGE: What, are you locking the door now?

JERRY: Well, well, look at you. It?s a little skimpy there isn't it?

GEORGE: Do you know the last time I wore this thing? Six years ago, when I made that toast at Bobby Leighton's wedding.

JERRY: Ooo, that was a bad toast.

GEORGE: It wasn't that bad.

JERRY: I never heard anybody curse in a toast.

GEORGE: I was trying to loosen 'em up a little bit.

JERRY: There were old people there, all the relatives. You were like a Red Fox record. I mean, at
