[Opening monologue]

JERRY: ....hair that was on your shower soap today could be in your head tomorrow. How did they do the first transplant? Did they have the guy take a shower , get his soap , rush it in there by helicopter, you know keep the soap alive on the soap support system ....looks it over. &quot;We got the hair but I think we lost the Zest.&quot; ....rejects the transplant with organs. Is it possible that a head could reject the hair transplant . Guy just standin' there and suddenly... ..Bink! ( motions hair flying out of his head)........lands in someone's frozen yogurt.


[Jerry's apartment]

(A repairman is working on his fridge , Jerry doing work with headphones on.)

REPAIRMAN: .....The gaskets that you have here are asymmetrical.

JERRY: Ah..ha!.. really. ( Jerry is barely listening to him )

REPAIRMAN: So I took off the motor relay on the compressor....'cos you..you (stutters) you've got some discoloration

JERRY: Oh! well whatever you have to do.

REPAIRMAN: I was working with one.....mount at a time 'cos you don't wanna disturb the position of the compressor.

JERRY: (sarcastically) No you don't..

(George enters the apartment.)

GEORGE: Hey! what are listening to?

JERRY: My show from last night.

GEORGE: Oh! you taped it?

JERRY: Yeah , I was doing new material.

GEORGE: Hey! Did 'ya ever do that thing on the toes that I said .

JERRY: Huh?

GEORGE: Yeah! like the big toe is like the captain of the toes, but sometimes the toe next to the big toe gets so big that there's like a power struggle and the second toe assumes control of the foot.

JERRY: The&quot; coup d&eacute;-toe&quot;

GEORGE: Yeah. Did you do it?

JERRY: Yeah!

GEORGE: So?

JERRY: Nothin'.....nothing at all.

GEORGE: Need to use the phone.

JERRY: Who you calling?

GEORGE: China.

JERRY: China really?

GEORGE: Yeah. I'll pay for it.

GEORGE: What for? . I'll tell you what for.... for hair.

JERRY: Hair?

GEORGE: The Chinese have done it my friend. The Chinese have done it.

JERRY: Done what?

GEORGE: Discovered a cure for baldness.

REPAIRMAN: Did you see that last night?

GEORGE: It was on CNN ( Kramer comes in and he is taping from a Camcorder) This Chinese doctor Zeng Zau. has discovered a cure for baldness.

JERRY: (to Kramer) What's this?

KRAMER: Well I just got it. Spector gave it to me , he's giving everything away...becoming a minimalist.

GEORGE: Is that the guy who likes fat women?

JERRY: Doesn't the fat fetish conflict with the minimalism.

KRAMER: (to George) You , you know what you should've done is watching that report on CNN last night.

GEORGE: I did, I'm trying to call China.

KRAMER: You can't call China now its like, what, three 'O clock in the morning there

JERRY: Oh! my God!....

GEORGE: What?

JERRY: Oh! God.. Oh! man.....Oh! brother!!! I can't believe what I'm hearing. This woman his talking to me on my tape recorder while I was on stage. This is wild. I've never heard anything like this in my life. Listen to this.

KRAMER: Give me it..( tries to pull them off George's head)

GEORGE: Wa..Wait.Wait!......Who is this woman?

JERRY: I don't know . I have no idea . I was just listening and she came on.

GEORGE: This is like a Penthouse letter...Why can't I meet women like this?

KRAMER: All right Come on....again attempts to pull headphones off)

GEORGE: WAIT ,WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!!!!.... Where was the tape recorder?

JERRY: It was in the back of the room on the left, she must have been sitting right in front of it.

GEORGE: My god!!!

KRAMER: C'mon it's my turn.

GEORGE: All right, All right, all, right!!( gives the headphones to Kramer) How you gonna find out who this is?

JERRY: Good question.

KRAMER: Where's the volume..(finds it) A, YAI..YA...YA..YA!!!!


[Cut to Monks]

GEORGE: What do the Chinese have to gain by faking a cure for baldness?

JERRY: If it was real ,they would never let it out of the country. No baldness , it'd be like a nation of Supermen.

ELAINE: Hi boys.

BOTH: Hello...

ELAINE: What's happening?

JERRY: Tell her. I wanna hear her reaction.

GEORGE: This woman left this really sexy message on Jerry's tape recorder......

GEORGE: I thought you meant the..

JERRY: No I meant the bald cure. We were talking about the bald cure.

ELAINE: What did she say?

PETER: Seinfeld.....( from way in the back of the restaurant. Cheesy plot device to have Jerry leave the table for a minute so George and Elaine can talk)

JERRY: Hey! Is that Peter? ...I can't believe it. Get me a cup of Decaf. (leaves table)

ELAINE: So did you hear this message?

GEORGE: Oh!, he he, It was unbelievable

(Jerry comes back)

JERRY: Remember Peter?

GEORGE: Peter?

JERRY: You remember Peter. remember I told you how he went to the track that one time and he was yelling at this jockey and the jockey got off the horse and started chasin' him.

ELAINE: So listen , what about this girl on the tape recorder?

JERRY: Oh Elaine....What do you think an enraptured female fan of mine might say?

ELAINE: I don't know.

JERRY: She went on in some detail about certain activities, illegal in some states, for consenting adults. Things you would know very little about.

ELAINE: Oh! really.

JERRY: Well this type of things is very common when you're in show business.

ELAINE: So what, Are you gonna ask her out.

[Back to Jerry's]

GEORGE: Oh! my god. Oh! man...

JERRY: I don't get it. Why would a woman do that and then leave no way to get in touch with her.

ELAINE: (coming out of the shower in a bathrobe) May be she realized she could never have you and she jumped off the George Washington Bridge.

GEORGE: (phone rings ,picks up) Operator? Beijing?

JERRY: Why are you doing this?

GEORGE: Why do I do anything? tsss...For women.

JERRY: Elaine have you ever gone out with a bald man?

KRAMER: What is that?

JERRY: That's my cockney accent.

KRAMER: Naw ,na , that's no good.

JERRY: Lets hear yours.

KRAMER: Not bloody likely..

JERRY: That's the worst cockney accent I've ever heard in my life.( George enters) Hey! Georgie boy , guess what I got.

KRAMER: Wait,wait wait...Let me get the camera.

GEORGE: No Don't get the camera , we don't need the camera. Listen I know your skeptical , but I really believe in the Chinese.

JERRY: Yes I am skeptical.
