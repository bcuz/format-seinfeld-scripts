[Opening Monologue]

The thing I don't understand about the suicide person is the people who try and commit suicide for some reason they don't die and that's it. They stop trying. Why? Why don't they just keep trying? What has changed? Is their life any better now? No. In fact it's worse because now they've found out one more thing you stink at. Okay, that's why these people don't succeed in life to begin with. Because they give up too easy. I saw, pills don't work, try a rope. Car won't start in the garage, get a tune up. You know what I mean? There's nothing more rewarding than reaching a goal you have set for yourself.


[Jerry's Apartment]

JERRY: Let me ask you a question. If you named a kid Rasputin do you think that would have a negative effect on his life?

ELAINE: Na.

JERRY: What are you doing? We're going out for dinner in ten minutes.

ELAINE: Do you realize this is the last meal I am going to have for three days?

(buzzer)

JERRY: Yeah.

GEORGE: It's George.

JERRY: Come on up. . . . I never heard of this. You've got to fast for three days to take an ulcer test. How you gonna do that?

ELAINE: I don't know. How could I possibly have ulcers? Who could have given me ulcers?

JERRY: I think I'll take out the garbage.

ELAINE: Hey, have you ever fasted?

JERRY: Well, once I didn't have dinner until, like 9:00 o'clock, that was pretty rough. (exits to hall with garbage - meets George) Hey, do me a favour will ya'? Throw out my garbage for me.

GEORGE: Yeah, right.

JERRY: Come on, it's just down the hall.

GEORGE: Give me two bucks. I'll do it for two bucks.

JERRY: I'll give you 50 cents.

GEORGE: There's no way I touch that bag for less than two dollars.

JERRY: Come on. Fifty cents. (??) a piece of Drake's coffee cake

GEORGE: You're not getting no Drake's Coffee Cake for fifty cents. Yae, Hey, I'm all set. I got the ticket. I'm going to the Cayman Islands this Friday.

JERRY: I don't get you. Who goes on vacation without a job? What do you need a break from getting up at eleven?

GEORGE: It's an incredible deal. I don't know why you don't come with me.

JERRY: Nah, I don't go for these non-refundable deals. I can't commit to a woman. I'm not going to commit to an airline.

(Gina enters the hall)

GINA: Hi.

JERRY: Hi.

GINA: How are you?

JERRY: Gina, do you know what a Drake's Coffee Cake is?

GINA: Of course, the plane cake with the sweet brown crumbs on the top.

JERRY: How much do they cost?

GINA: The junior?

GEORGE: No, no the full size.

JERRY: No, no the junior.

GEORGE: You didn't say &quot;junior&quot;.

GINA: I haven't had one of those since I was a little girl.

JERRY: Really? You should be ashamed of yourself. I want you out of here! (MARTIN enters the hall) How ya' doing?

MARTIN: Good enough.

(MARTIN leaves with Gina)

JERRY: Boy she's sexy isn't she?

(Jerry leaves garbage bag by Kramer's apartment and knocks on the door. As he and George enter Jerry's apartment Kramer comes out and takes the garbage bag.)

JERRY: Do you believe that guy?

ELAINE: What guy?

JERRY: My neighbour:

ELAINE: Oh, that creepy guy?

JERRY: Yeah, did he think I was flirting with her?

GEORGE: He didn't seem too pleased.

ELAINE: Maybe I'll get a steak with french fried onion wings.

GEORGE: hey, you know what? I just remembered something. I had a dream about that guy last night. This is amazing.

JERRY: What's so amazing? You've seen him before.

GEORGE: I haven't seen him for months.

JERRY: What was the dream?

GEORGE: I was doing standup comedy in Kennebunkport Maine. ??? night club. The stage was on a cliff and the audience was throwing all the comics off.

JERRY: I think I've played there.

GEORGE: I've had a lot of other paranormal stuff happen to me.

JERRY: You're a little paranormal

ELAINE: Hey, George, you know my friend goes to a psychic.

GEORGE: Really?

ELAINE: Uh uh, you should go some time.

GEORGE: I'd love to go. Make an appointment.

JERRY: Psychics, vacations. How about getting a job?

GEORGE: I just got fired.

JERRY: Alright, come on, lets get out of here.

ELAINE: I wonder what Ghandi ate before his fast.

JERRY: I heard he used to polish off a box of Triscuits.

ELAINE: Really?

JERRY: Oh, yeah. Ghandi loved Triscuits.

(They exit)


[Jerry's apartment late at night there is knocking at the door]

JERRY: Who is it? Who is it?

GINA: It's Gina.

JERRY: Who?

GINA: Martine's girl friend.

JERRY: Martine?

GINA: You next door neighbour.

JERRY: Oh, Martin!

(Jerry opens door)

GEORGE: It's Martine. I think he's dying. He tried to kill himself with pills.

JERRY: What?

GINA: Come on.

JERRY: In my pajamas? I better get my robe.

GINA: We don't have enough time.

JERRY: It'll take two seconds.

GINA: There is no time.

JERRY: We don't have two seconds?

GINA: All right. Go ahead.

JERRY: Nah, forget it.

GINA: No, go ahead.

JERRY: Nah. I'll just wear the pajamas.

GINA: Will you just get it.

JERRY: Are you sure?

GINA: Forget it. Come on.

JERRY: Nah, I'll go get the robe.


[Metropolitan Hospital Center]

JERRY: That's not too bad. It's not like a Sunny von Bulow comma. The doctor said he should snap out of it anytime.

GINA: You know why he did this? Because I told him it was over. I did not want to see him anymore.

JERRY: Really? It's over?

GINA: I could not stand it another minute. Yesterday he turned over a man's hot dog stand because he thought the man was looking at me. And then after he saw you in the hall. Ach, he was crazy with jealousy.

JERRY: Oh boy, did he say anything about me?

GINA: He does not like you. And all indications are he does not like Drake's Coffee Cake.

JERRY: He said that?

GINA: He was screaming about it all night. How it's too sweet and it falls apart when you eat it.

JERRY: I'm sorry if I caused any trouble. I was just being friendly.

GINA: I wasn't.

JERRY: You weren't?

GINA: No, I have thought about you many times. Have you thought about me?

JERRY: Of course.

GINA: Tell me everything.

JERRY: Are you sure he can't hear anything? . . .MARTIN, MARTIN.

GINA: I wish he was not in a coma. I wish he was dead. I wish I could pull the plug out from him.

JERRY: I, would, I would wait on that. I know how you feel but. Juries today, you never know how they're going to look at a thing like this.

GINA: I saw you looking at your watch. You want to leave? Go ahead.

JERRY: No, I just wanted to see what time it was.

GINA: Are you afraid of him?

JERRY: No.

GINA: Then kiss me.

JERRY: Here?

GINA: Yes, right here.

JERRY: Is this the proper venue?

GINA: You don't want to?

JERRY: No, no, I want to. I, I very much want to. I, I desire to. I, I pine to.

GINA: Then kiss me right in front of him.

JERRY: I can't. What if he wakes up?

GINA: A man is lying here unconscious and you're afraid of him? What kind of a man are you?

JERRY: A man who respects a good comma. If it was one of those in and out comas, maybe. But when a guy's got a coma going like this &#133; you don't want to mess with it.


[Jerry's apartment]

KRAMER: Hey.

JERRY: Hey.

KRAMER: Did you hear about Martin?

JERRY: Yeah, I heard.

KRAMER: I can't believe he's in a coma.

KRAMER: He's got my vacuum cleaner. You know I loaned it to him. He never returned it. The carpets are filthy. What am I going to do?

JERRY: Who told you about Martin?

KRAMER: Newman! He's good friends with him.

JERR: Oh, big mouth Newman. I should have guessed.

KRAMER: He's got all of my attachments, you know.

JERRY: Hey, let me ask you something. How long do you have to wait for a guy to come out of a coma before you can ask his ex-girlfriend out?

KRAMER: What, Gina? Why wait? Why not just call Doctor Kavorkian?

JERRY: You know I don't get that whole suicide machine. There's no tall buildings where these people live? They can't wrap their lips around a revolver like a normal person?

KRAMER: So what's going on between you and Gina?

JERRY: Well, I went with her to the hospital last night.

KRAMER: Uh, uh.

JERRY: So we're in the room and she's trying to get me to kiss her right in front of him.

KRAMER: Uh, uh, you see that's the great thing about Mediterranean women. All right, so what did you do?

JERRY: Nothing.

KRAMER: Ah, what kind of a man are you? The guy is unconscious in a coma and you don't have the guts to kiss his girlfriend?

JERRY: I didn't know what the coma etiquette was.

KRAMER: There is no coma etiquette. You see that's the beauty of the coma, man. It doesn't matter what you do around it.

JERRY: So you're saying, his girl, his car, his clothes, it's all up for grabs. You can just loot the coma victim.

KRAMER: I'd give him 24 hours to get out of it. They can't get out of it in 24 hours, it's a land rush.

JERRY: So if the coma victim wakes up in a month, he's thrilled, he got out of the coma. He goes home, there's nothing left?

KRAMER: NOTHING LEFT! That's why I'm trying to get that vacuum cleaner. Because somebody's going to grab it.


[The psychic's apartment]

RULA: Martin's spirit came to you as a warning.

ELAINE: Why would he come to George?

RULA: Because George has heightened extra sensory perception. FAYGY GET YOUR FINGER OUT OF YOUR NOSE.

GEORGE: I knew it. I always felt different.

RULA: You are. Some coffee cake?

GEORGE: Drakes?

RULA: Yes.

GEORGE: Did you buy this for me?

RULA: No, why?

GEORGE: Ha, because I love Drake's Coffee Cake.

RULA: Maybe I did.

ELAINE: Take it away.

GEORGE: She hasn't eaten in two days.

RULA: Who's Pauline?

GEORGE: Pauline? . . . Wait a minute. I got it. My brother once impregnated a woman named Pauline.

RULA: Do you think about her?

GEORGE: When I hear her name mentioned.

RULA: Cut these with your left hand.

GEORGE: There was a woman, Audrey. She had a very big nose.

RULA: I see an Audrey, but with a small nose.

GEORGE: Yes, yes, she had a nose job. I loved her very deeply. Will she ever speak to me again?

RULA: Not in this life.

ELAINE: Should you be smoking?

RULA: Does it bother you?

ELAINE: You're pregnant.

GEORGE: Elaine.

RULA: I smoked when I had Faisy.

RULA: Ah oh.

GEORGE: Ah oh? What? What Ah oh?

RULA: I don't know about this trip George.

GEORGE: You can see the Cayman Islands in there? Is something going to happen to me? What?

ELAINE: It's really bad for the fetus. Do you know that.

GEORGE: Elaine, she's a psychic. She knows how the kid's going to be.

GEORGE: Should I not go on this trip?

RULA: George, I am going to tell you something and I want you to really hear me.

ELAINE: Now listen. I just don't know how a person, with everything we now know about pre-natal care can put a cigarette in her mouth.

GEORGE: Elaine, what are you doing?

ELAINE: It's disgusting.

RULA: I DON'T BELIVE IT. I would like you both to leave.

ELAINE: Oh fine, I don't like to be around people who are just so irresponsible.

RULA: Get the hell out.

(Elaine leaving)

GEORGE: A plane crash? A Heart attack? Lupus? Is it Lupus?

RULA: Do you want me to call the super? He was an Israeli commando.

GEORGE: If you don't say anything I will assume it's a plane crash.

RULA: Get out.

GEORGE: Not a plane crash. (leaving) Is it a plane crash?


[Jerry's apartment]

GINA: I do not like your toothbrush. There are no bristles.

JERRY: You can say what you want about me but I'll be damned if I'm going to stand here while you insult my toothbrush.

GINA: It is too small for someone with such a big mouth (kisses Kerry). Let me ask you. What will you do if Martine wakes up? Run away like a mouse?

JERRY: No, more like the Three Stooges at 

The End
