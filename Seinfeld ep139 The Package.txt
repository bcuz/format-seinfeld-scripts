[Kramer and Newman at the park, smoking cigars]

KRAMER: Well, I really miss the Bermuda Triangle.

NEWMAN: I guess there's not much action down there these days.

KRAMER: Oh, there's action. There's plenty of action. That damned alien autopsy is stealing all the headlines.

NEWMAN: Yeah, tell me about it.

KRAMER: See, what they gotta do is loose a plane or a Greenpeace boat in there. See, that would get the triangle going again.

NEWMAN: What keeps the water in there? I mean, why doesn't it disappear?

KRAMER: What would be the point in taking the water?

NEWMAN: It's gorgeous water. (pause) Do we own Bermuda?

KRAMER: No. It belongs to the British.

NEWMAN: Lucky krauts.

KRAMER: So, what do you think about that alien autopsy?

NEWMAN: Oh, that's real.

KRAMER: I think so too.


<font size="-2">[Elaine at the doctor's]

ATTENDANT: The doctor will be with you in a moment. 

(Elaine looking at her chart) 

ELAINE: Difficult? 

DOCTOR: Elaine. You shouldn't be reading that. So tell me about this rash of yours. 

ELAINE: Well it's, it's..... You know I noticed that somebody wrote in my chart that I was difficult in January of 92 and I have to tell you that I remember that appointment exactly. You see this nurse asked me to put a gown on but it was a mole on my shoulder and I specifically wore a tank top so I wouldn't have to put a gown on. You know there made of paper. 

DOCTOR: Well that was a long time ago. How about if I just erase it. Now about that rash...... 

ELAINE: But it was in pen. You fake erase. 

DOCTOR: All right Miss Benes. This doesn't look to serious. You'll be fine.

ELAINE: What are you writing? Doctor. 


[George at Photo Shop] 

SHEILA: Here you go. 

GEORGE: Thanks. 

SHEILA: I hope you got that mustard stain out of your shirt. 

GEORGE: Ohhhhhh 


[Jerry, Kramer, and George at the apartment] 

JERRY: No. All you got to do is jiggle it with this screwdriver. 

GEORGE: Smile 

JERRY: What are you doing? 

GEORGE: I meet this women, Sheila. She works down at the one hour photo pace. She's got this incredible smile. Like she's got extra teeth or something 

JERRY: Extra teeth. I love that look. 

GEORGE: Hey check this out. I go to pick up my pictures and she says &quot; I hope you got that mustard stain out of your shirt.&quot; 

JERRY: What mustard stain? 

GEORGE: Don't you see. She's looking at my pictures. 

JERRY: Why did you take a picture of a mustard stain? 

GEORGE: That's got nothing to do with it. 

JERRY: I see. She's looking. 

GEORGE: Yesssss. 

KRAMER: Hey, you got to get this thing fixed. 

JERRY: They've tried to fix it. But it keeps coming back the same. 

KRAMER: Would you like a refund? 

JERRY: Well I can't the warranty expired two years ago. 

KRAMER: Would you be interested? 

JERRY: Well how are you going..... 

KRAMER: Would you? 

JERRY: I guess I would. 

KRAMER: Yeah, yeah. 

(Elaine walks in) 

ELAINE: You are not going to believe what happened to me at the doctors office today. 

JERRY: Not the gown again. 

ELAINE: No, no. I was looking at my chart and it said I was difficult. Why would they write that? 

JERRY: They have gotten to know you. 

(Kramer leaves with Jerry's stereo) 

ELAINE: Then the doctor writes more stuff down and doesn't even look at my rash. 

GEORGE: Why don't you find a doctor that doesn't know your difficult. 

ELAINE: Oh come on. I'm not difficult. I'm easy. 

JERRY: Why because you dress casual and sleep with a lot of guys. 

ELAINE: Listen to me you little shi........ 

GEORGE: Smile. 


[Elaine at another doctor's office] 

DOCTOR: Well Elaine you really didn't have to put on the gown. 

ELAINE: Oh it's my pleasure. I love these. In fact I got one at home. It's perfect when you just want to throw something on. 

(Nurse hands the doctor her chart) 

DOCTOR: All rightly. Let me just review your history before we begin. 

ELAINE: Where did you get my chart? 

DOCTOR: From your last doctor. It's a standard procedure. 

ELAINE: You know I can tell you my whole history. Let's just....... 

DOCTOR: Okay. Let's take a look. Well that doesn't look to serious. You'll be fine. 

ELAINE: Please, please. It's really, really itchy. 

(Doctor writes more stuff in her chart) 


[Jerry at apartment] 

(Knock, knock)

POSTAL WORKER DANNY: Seinfeld? 

JERRY: Yeah. 

POSTAL WORKER DANNY: I got a package for you. Sign here. 

JERRY: Who's it from? 

POSTAL WORKER DANNY: No return address. 

JERRY: What if I don't want it? 

POSTAL WORKER: Are you refusing delivery? 

JERRY: Maybe I am. 

POSTAL WORKER DANNY: Why would you do that? 

JERRY: I've never done it before. 

POSTAL WORKER DANNY: Why start now? 

JERRY: Why not? 

POSTAL WORKER DANNY: All right. 

(George walks in) 

GEORGE: Why did you refuse the package. Everybody loves a package. 

JERRY: I don't know it was weird. Crazy printing. I don't know who it was from. 

GEORGE: What do you think it's a bomb? 

JERRY: It's not totally impossible. 

GEORGE: Oh the ego on you. 

JERRY: Why can't I be bombable? 

GEORGE: Who's going to bomb you. An airline for all the stupid little peanut jokes. 

JERRY: I suppose you think your bombable. 

GEORGE: Hey. There is a couple of people that wouldn't mind having me out of the way. 

JERRY: There's more than a couple. 

GEORGE: Hey. Check these out. I just picked them up from Sheila. She must have loved these. 

JERRY: You don't have a Mercedes. 

GEORGE: I know. I just sort of leaned on it so it would look like it was mine. 

JERRY: The driver seems a little put out. 

GEORGE: No. He was fine with it. Check that out. 

JERRY: Is that Burt Reynolds? 

GEORGE: Wax Museum. 

JERRY: Oh. 

GEORGE: Oh. What is this? 

JERRY: That's a lot of skin. 

GEORGE: This must be Sheila from the photo place. 

JERRY: You can barely see her face. 

GEORGE: She must have slipped it in here. 

(Kramer walks in) 

KRAMER: I I I 

GEORGE: Photo store Sheila. 

KRAMER: Well hello Photo store Sheila. 

GEORGE: All right. I will see you boys later. 

JERRY: Where are you going? 

GEORGE: To ask her out. 

KRAMER: No, no. Your not playing the game. 

GEORGE: What game? 

KRAMER: She goes to these lengths to entice you and your only response is &quot; Gee I really like your picture. Would you like to go out on a date with me please. &quot; 

GEORGE: No good? 

KRAMER: George. It's the timeless art of seduction. You got to join in the dance. She sends you an enticing photo, you send her one right back. 

GEORGE: Oh, I don't know. 

KRAMER: Well as you know I've always been something of a photog. 

JERRY: Oh yeah I like this idea. 


[Outside Uncle Leo's apartment] 

UNCLE LEO: Hey Danny. Hello. How are you? 

POSTAL WORKER DANNY: Hey Leo. Leo what's up with your nephew. He wouldn't except his package. 

UNCLE LEO: Oh He wants it. He's just trying to be funny. Yeah I'll sign it .


[George and Elaine in taxi] 

ELAINE: And then he starts writing on my chart. 

GEORGE: Well why don't you get a hold of it and change what you don't like. 

ELAINE: You can't change your chart. It's your chart. 

GEORGE: I am in and out of my personnel file at work all the time. 

ELAINE: You are!?! 

GEORGE: Hey. I've kept the same job for more than two years. It's not luck. Elaine, have you ever sent a racy photograph of yourself to anyone? 

ELAINE: Yeah. I sent one to everyone I know. Remember my Christmas card. 

GEORGE: Oh yeah the nipple. But besides that. How did you feel about Kramer's work? 

ELAINE: Actually I thought he was very professional. 

GEORGE: So it was a good experience. 

ELAINE: Oh yeah. In fact I like the picture so much I cropped out the nipple and am using as my health club ID. 

GEORGE: Nice. 

ELAINE: Yeah it is nice actually. 


[Elaine at another doctors] 

ELAINE: I need to see Dr. Burke right away. This rash is spreading. 

ATTENDANT: He can't see you Miss Benes, he's busy. 

ELAINE: Oh come on. Have some compassion. Okay well I hope it's contagious 

(Elaine rubs the attendants phone on her neck. Soon after Elaine finds her chart and runs to the elevator) 

ELAINE: Come on. Move. (elevator doors reopen; Dr. Burke and two orderlies are revealed) Oh hi Dr. Burke. I didn't know if uh.... 

DR. BURKE: The chart Miss Benes. 

(The doctor writes more stuff in it) 

ELAINE: Oh please no more. 


[Jerry at his apartment] 

(George walks in) 

JERRY: Hey 

GEORGE: Where's Kramer? 

JERRY: He went to get some steak sauce. Why? 

GEORGE: Personal matter. 

(Phone rings) 

JERRY: Hello 

UNCLE LEO: Jerry! It's your Uncle Leo! Hello! 

JERRY: Hello Leo. You don't have to yell. 

UNCLE LEO: I got your package. 

JERRY: How did you get my package? 

UNCLE LEO: What should I do with it? 

JERRY: I don't know what you should do with it. 

GEORGE: Tell him to open it. 

JERRY: I am not going to treat my uncle like a bomb defusing robot. 

UNCLE LEO: Jerry, Your cousin Jeffrey is in the Parks Production of &quot;The Mikado&quot;. I want you to go see it with me. 

JERRY: Open the package Leo. 

UNCLE LEO: Okay. Opening. 

JERRY: Opening. 

(Through the phone: BOOM!!!)


[Jerry's apartment later that day; Jerry and Elaine] 

ELAINE: So it wasn't a bomb. 

JERRY: No, No bomb. 

ELAINE: Well then what? 

JERRY: Oh stupid Leo was using one of those oven cleaners. He left the canister in there and the pilot light was on. The whole thing blew up. 

ELAINE: But he's okay? 

JERRY: Yeah but the explosion singed off his eyebrows, mustache everything. He's all smooth now. Look's like a seal. 

(Elaine on phone) 

ELAINE: Yeah I am still holding. 

(Jerry opens his package) 

JERRY: Is this my stereo? 

(Kramer walks in) 

KRAMER: Hey you got it. 

JERRY: What happened to my stereo? It's all smashed up. 

KRAMER: That's right. Now it looks like it was broken during shipping and I insured it for $400. 

JERRY: But you were supposed to get me a refund. 

KRAMER: You can't get a refund. Your warranty expired two years ago. 

JERRY: So were going to make the Post Office pay for my new stereo? 

KRAMER: It's just a write off for them. 

JERRY: How is it a write off? 

KRAMER: They just write it off. 

JERRY: Write it off what? 

KRAMER: Jerry all these big companies they write off everything 

JERRY: You don't even know what a write off is. 

KRAMER: Do you? 

JERRY: No. I don't. 

KRAMER: But they do and they are the ones writing it off. 

JERRY: I wish I just had the last twenty seconds of my life back. 

(Elaine still on phone) 

ELAINE: What?!? He doesn't have one appointment this whole month!?! Oh come on. I am dying here man. Hello, hello. 

JERRY: Still no luck 

(Kramer leaves with a fan) 

ELAINE: Jerry I am at doctor Zimmerman. I am at
