[Setting: Jerry's apartment]

(Jerry and George enter with some plastic bags)

JERRY: She hasn't told her father yet?

GEORGE: No. We're supposed to tell him tonight.

JERRY: &quot;We're&quot;? What do you mean, &quot;We're&quot;?

GEORGE: Susan wants me to be there.

JERRY: You're meetin' the father for the first time?

GEORGE: (Reluctantly) Yeah.

JERRY: (Chuckles slightly) Well, you'll make quite an impression on him when you tell him how you burned his cabin down.

GEORGE: I didn't burn it down - Kramer did!

JERRY: (Laughs) I mean, the whole thing is ironic. Think of it: Here the guy is nice enough to give you a box of very fine Cuban cigars..

GEORGE: Yeah, I know what happened.

JERRY: No, but wait, wait: And then you dump them off onto Kramer..

GEORGE: (Getting frustrated) I know.

JERRY: (Continuing) ..Who, who proceeds to burn the man's cabin down with one of those very same cigars! (Topping off his observation) It's very comical..

GEORGE: Listen, maybe we shouldn't start writing today. I got a lot on my mind.

JERRY: (Persisting) No, no, we put this off long enough. Today's the day.

GEORGE: (Letting his conscious get the best of him) I wonder how Susan's father's going to react to this. Alright, what- what's the worst he could do? So you burn a cabin down..

JERRY: (Agreeing) C'mon. It's not even a house - it's, like, a cabin.

GEORGE: We could build a cabin like (Snaps) that.

JERRY: (Blunt) Well, maybe not us, but two men could.

GEORGE: (Looking over the writing materials they just bought) Bics? What, d'ja get, bics?

JERRY: What, you got a problem with the pen now?

GEORGE: Well, I like a rolling writer. They're very smooth.

JERRY: Alright, let's just get to work. (They both move into the living room - ready to start writing their script. Jerry sits down) NBC Pilot, Seinfeld project. Act I, Scene A.

GEORGE: (Still standing) So, you're gonna sit there?

JERRY: (Wanting to get started) Just - just park yourself. (George reluctantly sits on the sofa) Alright. Act I, Scene A.

GEORGE: (Offering) Drink?

JERRY: No, no thank you.

GEORGE: (Uncapping his pen) Alright, here we go.

JERRY: Act I, Scene A..

(A long pause as they both attempt to start writing passes)

GEORGE: Weren't you supposed to call Elaine?

JERRY: (Eagerly reaching for the phone) Yes. (George turns the TV on, and begins watching as Jerry dials the number) Hi, is Elaine there? Oh, uh, Hi, Sandra. Uh, yeah. I can hold. (To George) Every time I call I gotta chit-chat with her assistant for, like, twenty minutes. (Back into the phone) Oh, hi, Sandra. Listen, I'm at a pay phone, and there's lots of people here waiting to use it. (Yelling out for believability) I'll be off in a minute! (To Sandra) Yeah, could you just put me through to Elaine? Okay, thanks! (He turns to George) Are you thinking of ideas? (George, picking his teeth with his finger, is absorbed into the television. He seems to not even notice Jerry) Listen, Elaine, is there any way I could get through to you directly? Every time I call Sandra bends my ear for, like, twenty minutes. (Pause) So we're on for later?

(Scene cuts to Elaine's office. She's waving a pencil around in her free hand)

ELAINE: Yeah, I'll come by after work. Hey, I got a rubber pencil thing happenin' here.. (Sandra passes her doorway) Uh, I gotta go. I gotta go. (Hangs up) Sandra! Sandra? Hi, can you come here for a second?

(Scene goes back to Jerry's apartment)

JERRY: Okay, let's go. (George shuts the television off, ready to work)

GEORGE: Alright, here we go. You got it?

JERRY: Yeah.

GEORGE: Here we go.

JERRY: Okay, how about this: I'm in my apartment, you come in.

GEORGE: (Holding out his arms - giving praise) It's beautiful. Now, what do I say?

(A long pause, then the scene jumps back to Elaine and Sandra)

ELAINE: Could you do me a favor? Um, when my friends call, could you not talk to them for too long?

SANDRA: Why? Did Jerry say something?

ELAINE: No, no.

SANDRA: He must have said something.

ELAINE: Oh, no, he didn't say anything.

SANDRA: (Near tears) I can't work for you! I can't. I'm leaving. (Exits quickly)

ELAINE: (Calling out to Sandra) No, Sandra. I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I really am! Listen, listen, Jerry's under a lot of pressure right now. It's very hard being a stand-up comedian! Sometimes they don't laugh!

(Scene goes back to Jerry's apartment. Jerry and George are sleeping. Kramer slams his apartment door shut, waking both of them up)

GEORGE: Alright, let's go.

JERRY: Here we go.

(Both get situated to write as Kramer enters)

KRAMER: Hey.

GEORGE: yeah, Kramer, we're, uh, kind of in the middle of something here. We're trying to do a little work..

JERRY: Yeah, come on. (Kramer gives out a frustrated sigh) What's with you?

KRAMER: (Complaining) No more golf.

JERRY: Why?

KRAMER: Well, you remember I told you about the pro, you know, at the Westchester Country Club, who's letting me play a round every time I give him a couple of those Cuban cigars?

JERRY: Yeah.

KRAMER: (Angered) Yeah, well, I lost them all in the fire! (Leaning over the couch, he addresses George) Hey, George, maybe you can ask Susan's father for more, huh?

GEORGE: What are you, Crazy? I can't ask the guy for more cigars after you burned down his cabin!

KRAMER: Why? What's one thing got to do with another?

GEORGE: Kramer, please.

KRAMER: Well, I can't go back to the public courses, now. I can't! I won't. I mean, you know what that's like? It's crowded, the grass has big brown patches in it, they don't rake the sand traps! Not to mention the caliber of people you have to play with!

GEORGE: Kramer, I can't help you. You're gonna have to get them some place else.

KRAMER: (Opening the door) Where? They're Cubans. (Leaves)

GEORGE: (Getting up) You know what? Maybe I should take off.

JERRY: What?!

GEORGE: Well, you know, I gotta go to, uh, Susan's parent's house for dinner.. and, you know, I want to shower first.. and I want to leave myself plenty of time.

JERRY: (Looking at his watch) You got four hours! What about the script?

GEORGE: I think we got a bite on it. (Exits)

(Scene ends)


[Setting: The Ross' house]

(Susan, her parents, and George are all dining)

MRS. ROSS: (To Mr. Ross) Doesn't George look like your sister, Sarah?

MR. ROSS: (Gruff) A slight resemblance.

(George laughs slightly)

MRS. ROSS: (To George) Her son's a podiatrist, you know.

GEORGE: Ohh, I have tremendous respect for people who work with feet. I mean, to dedicate yourself to the foot - you're toiling in virtual anonymity. I mean..

(Seeing the Ross' expression, he trails off)

MR. ROSS: How are you enjoying those cigars I gave you?

GEORGE: Oh, uh, the cigars.. (Chuckles nervously) I'm, uh, suckin' 'em down. I'm puffing my brains out, yeah.

MR. ROSS: You know those cigars are made special for Castro?

GEORGE: (Impersonating Carson) I didn't not know that. Weird. Wild. (Susan and George both laugh)

MR. ROSS: What?

SUSAN: (Explaining) He's doing Johnny Carson, daddy.

MR. ROSS: I didn't care much for his jokes.

SUSAN: (To George) Daddy never laughs.

GEORGE: Oh, well, so what? Laughter - what is that? I mean, what is the point of opening your mouth and going &quot;Ha, ha!&quot;? What is that? &quot;Ha, ha!&quot;?

MR. ROSS: You know, you can't get those cigars anywhere.

MRS. ROSS: You and your cigars..

MR. ROSS: (Shooting back at his wife) Wear some more lipstick.

SUSAN: Daddy, there's, um, there's something that we have to talk to you about..

MR. ROSS: Oh, I forgot to ask you - how'd you like the cabin?

GEORGE: (Even more nervous than before) Oh, the, uh, the cabin.. well, (Clears throat)

(Scene ends)


[Setting: Jerry's apartment]

(Jerry and Elaine are talking. Jerry's using a harsh tone)

JERRY: Right after we get off the phone, then you go and tell her that?! Well, of course she knows it was me who complained! Now I'm responsible for this woman's quitting. Oh, this is unbelievable!

ELAINE: (Full of guilt) I know! I screwed up. It's all my fault. Would you call her?

JERRY: (Caving in) Ohh.. dial the number. (Elaine picks up the phone, and starts to dial) How could you do this?

ELAINE: (Handing the phone over to him) I was just trying to help you.

JERRY: (Muttering) Oh, just trying to (Rudely grabs the phone from her) help me.. (Into the phone) Hello? Sandra? Hi, uh, this is Jerry Seinfeld. (Elaine now has her hand in a bowl of popcorn - grabbing a fistful) Listen, I - I just want to tell you, (Jerry sternly grabs Elaine's hand - forcing her to drop the popcorn, then shoves her hand away. Elaine sits back like a scolded child) There's been a terrible misunderstanding: See, I told Elaine that, uh, it was a real treat talking to you on the phone, and she thought I was being sarcastic, you know, 'cause I'm a comedian and all. She thought I meant (Deeply sarcastic) &quot;Yeah, it was a real treat talking to her on the phone.&quot; (Back to normal) You know, but I was really being sincere.. No, of course I like you.. Tonight? ..Um, uh, hold on a second. (To Elaine, whispering) Now she wants to have a drink with me. (Elaine mouths out &quot;Just go&quot; while making gestures. Jerry, again, gives in. Back on the phone) Yeah, I think I can.. Um.. yeah, I know where that is.. Ok.. uh, I'll see you there. Okay, bye. (Hangs up, peeved) Now I gotta have a drink with her.

(Scene ends)


[Setting: The Ross' house]

(Same diner party is going on. News of the cabin has yet to be discussed)

GEORGE: The cabin.. (Laughs nervously) Well.. (Pauses as he thinks of a way to break the news, then decides to pass it off) Susan?

SUSAN: Uhh.. about the cabin..

MR. ROSS: (Cutting her off) I love that place. My father built that cabin in 1947. My mother was recuperating from Impetigo at the time, and dad thought it would be a good idea to get her out into the fresh air. She died there the following winter. And he passed away 10 years later to the day. His last words to me were, (Mrs. Ross, bored out of her mind, has obviously heard this story a million times - she mouths the words as Mr. Ross says them) &quot;Cherish the cabin.&quot; Not, uh, &quot;Take care of your sister.&quot; (Adding) She's a paraplegic. But, &quot;Cherish the cabin.&quot; (Smiling, reflecting) And I have.. for 45 years. It's often been a.. sanctuary for me.

GEORGE: (Annoyingly butting in) Kinda like Superman's fortress of solitude.

MR. ROSS: What?

GEORGE: S, uh, Superman - he, uh, built the fortress of solitude up at the North Pole, to, uh, you know, sort of get away from it all..

MR. ROSS: When I go, I'm passing it on to her. (Pointing at Susan)

MRS. ROSS: (Drunk, she laughs out loud) I'll take a hotel any day.

SUSAN: Daddy..

MR. ROSS: Yes?

SUSAN: Daddy, about the cabin..

MRS. ROSS: (Laughing, she points to her shirt) Look, Henry, I spilled wine on me! (Laughs again)

MR. ROSS: (To Susan) What about it?

SUSAN: Well, the thing is..

MR. ROSS: What? What is it?

SUSAN: Well, the - the cabin, is, kind of, uh.. George?

GEORGE: (Extremely blunt) Burned.

MR. ROSS: Burned?

SUSAN: There was a fire, and it uh..

GEORGE: Burned.

MR. ROSS: (Still trying to comprehend what has happened) The cabin burned?

GEORGE: (Laughs) yeah, burned. Whoo..

MRS. ROSS: (Laughing out loud) Burned! (George laughs with her)

MR. ROSS: Was anything found? Was it all burned to the ground?! Did they find anything?

SUSAN: (Solemn) No. Nothing.

MRS. ROSS: (Laughing, she's obviously getting a kick out of her husband's misfortune) Nothing! Ha, ha, ha.

(Mr. Ross, devastated, slowly gets up and starts walking toward the room's exit as everyone continues to talk)

GEORGE: Eh, but, you know, Mr. Ross, if - if you look at the whole situating, what with it being your cigars, and everything, it's really rather ironic - one might even say, in a sense, comical.. (Mr. Ross has, by now, left the room. Mrs. Ross is pointing at George, nodding, laughing. As if to say he hit the bullseye. George calls out to Mr. Ross) Really. Think about it.

(Scene ends)


[Setting: Jerry's apartment]

(Sandra runs out of Jerry's room, hastily putting on her jacket. Jerry follow, buttoning his shirt)

SANDRA: (Offended) I can't believe you said that!

JERRY: What?!

SANDRA: (Buttoning her jacket) How could you say something like that to me?!

JERRY: What? What?! You were the one who was talking dirty. I was just trying to keep up!

SANDRA: That was a weird thing to say.

JERRY: Why? It didn't mean anything. I was just trying to join in so you wouldn't feel embarrassed.

SANDRA: Ohh, I think you're really sick.

JERRY: (Getting slightly offended) I'm not sick. (Pointing at her) You - you said much sicker things than me.

SANDRA: I'm leaving. (Moves toward the door. Jerry blocks her path)

JERRY: I really think you're making too much of this.

SANDRA: (Attempting to get past him) Excuse me. (They both move to the door)

JERRY: Let me walk you to a cab.

SANDRA: (Opens the door) That's ok.

JERRY: I mean, the main thing is that this is just between us, and that'll be 

The End
