						[Opening Monologue] <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You know doctor is supposed to be such a prestigious occupation. But it&#146;s really like one of the only jobs where you have to have your diploma right up there on the wall. It makes them seem so insecure, doesn&#146;t it? &quot;I really am a doctor you know. You think I&#146;m not, just check it out.&quot; I don&#146;t know why they need these little bits of psychological leverage over us all the time. &quot;Go in that little room, take your pants off, wait 15 minutes, and I&#146;ll give you my opinion.&quot; After that, anyone that comes in with pants on seems like they know what they&#146;re talking about. In any difference of opinion, pants always beats no-pants. <br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[At a restaurant.] <br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Can I say one word to you? Lobster. The lobster here is unbelievable. (looks at the menu) Ooh, a little expensive. <br>
							<br>
							
						SASHA: Twenty five dollars. <br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Yes, well, you know, I&#146;m not thinking about the price. You know you&#146;re the only woman I&#146;ve never thought about the price. Get the lobster. I beg you to get the lobster. Go for the lobster. <br>
							<br>
							
						SASHA: George, George, uh, I think we have to talk. I think we have a problem. <br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: We do? <br>
							<br>
							
						SASHA: We can&#146;t keep seeing each other. <br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Why? <br>
							<br>
							
						SASHA: (crying) Because it&#146;s over. (sob, sob, sob) It&#146;s my parents George, the differences in our religion. Oh George, can you ever forgive me? (sob) <br>
							<br>
							
						WAITER:: Uh, have you decided yet? <br>
							<br>
							
						SASHA: (crying) Yes. I&#146;ll have the lobster. <br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Um, you know I&#146;m starting to think that maybe lobster isn&#146;t the way to go. <br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[The hallway outside Jerry&#146;s apartment.] <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Then he asked you out? <br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: We started to talk, and I told him that I jog, and then he put his hand on my heart. <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: On your heart? <br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Jerry, the man is a doctor. <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Doctor? He&#146;s a podiatrist. <br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: So, it&#146;s the same thing. <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Anyone can get into podiatry school. George got into podiatry school. <br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Really? <br>
							<br>
							
						TAWNI: Hello. <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Oh hi. <br>
							<br>
							
						TAWNI: Are you going to be stopping by later? <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yes, I&#146;ll be stopping. <br>
							<br>
							
						TAWNI: Ok, see you later.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: See you later. (to Elaine) Well we can&#146;t all be dating podiatrists. (Elaine laughs)<br>
							<br>
							
						(They enter Jerry&#146;s apartment. George is laying on the couch) <br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: It&#146;s over. <br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: What? <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: How did you get in? <br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Kramer. <br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: What&#146;s that? (points at some foil on the table)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Lobster. <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Looks like a swan. <br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: She says we can&#146;t go out anymore. <br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Why? <br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Because I&#146;m not Latvian Orthodox. Her parents won&#146;t let her get involved with anyone who isn&#146;t Latvian Orthodox. <br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Latvian Orthodox? (gasps) Mmm, it is lobster. <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: She&#146;s limiting herself to Latvian Orthodox? Too bad. <br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I know. This was the only woman I never lied to. Well that&#146;s not entirely true. <br>
							<br>
							
						(Jerry hands Elaine a folk and they dig into the lobster)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Oh, whatever.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Mmm, this is delicious. <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Mmm, succulent. <br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: She knew I didn&#146;t have a job, she knew I lived at home. Didn&#146;t seem to bother her. I think I could have married this woman. <br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Why don&#146;t you just ask her parents? <br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I can&#146;t. I met them. They&#146;re devout. You know, in the cab on the way over here, I actually thought about converting. <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: To Latvian Orthodox? <br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Why not? What do I care? <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You know it&#146;s not like changing toothpaste. <br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I think it would be romantic. <br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Really? <br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Yeah, it&#146;s like Edward the Eighth abdicating the throne and marrying Mrs. Simpson. Ooh. <br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: King Edward. (snapping his fingers) King Edward, Jerry. <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yeah well King Edward didn&#146;t live in Queens with Frank and Estelle Costanza. <br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: You know what? I could probably do this. What&#146;s the difference. <br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: George I was just kidding around. <br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: No. I wouldn&#146;t even have to tell her. I could surprise her. <br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: George I wasn&#146;t serious. <br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: How hard could it be? You make a little contribution, you have a ceremony. I am going to think about this. I am really going to think about this. <br>
							<br>
							
						(George leaves.) <br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I guess this one is my fault. <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Oh yeah. <br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[At Tawni&#146;s apartment] <br>
							<br>
							
						TAWNI: (kiss, kiss, kiss) Oh that was nice. Have you always been such a good kisser? <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Oh I don&#146;t know. Not always. No I uh I had to work at it. When I was a kid all the kids would be out playing, I would be up in my room practicing my kissing. <br>
							<br>
							
						TAWNI: Well it was worth it. (kiss) I&#146;ll be (kiss) right (kiss) back (kiss). Where are you going? <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: To wash my hands. They&#146;re sticky from the orange. <br>
							<br>
							
						TAWNI: Meet you back here? <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Right there. <br>
							<br>
							
						(Jerry goes into the bathroom and washes his hands. He sees the medicine cabinet open slightly and peeks in. )<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (thinking to himself; picks up a tube) &quot;Fungicide&quot;. Fungus? <br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[At Monk&#146;s.] <br>
							<br>
							
						(Jerry, Kramer, and Elaine eating at the normal booth)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Fungicide. I mean what could she have? <br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I don&#146;t know. <br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Fungus. <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Exactly<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: So what did you say? <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I said I was coming down with the flu or something and I had to go home. <br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I don't know, what were you doing opening her medicine cabinet? <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I didn&#146;t open it. It was open. I just nudged it a little. <br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: You were snooping. <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I was not snooping. I did not break the seal. There was no breaking and entering. I wouldn&#146;t do that. <br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: I would. I always open medicine cabinets. <br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Well I trust people not to do that. <br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Big mistake. <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Why don&#146;t you ask that doctor what it is? <br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: What? Now he&#146;s a doctor? Before he was a podiatrist. <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: But that&#146;s what podiatrists do. They deal in fungus. They&#146;re knee- deep in fungus. This guy knows fungus. <br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I am not going to ask him about funguses. <br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Fungi. <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What? <br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Fungi. <br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[In the priest&#146;s office.] <br>
							<br>
							
						FATHER-PRIEST: Why do you want to accept the Latvian Orthodox faith? <br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (ahem) In this age of uncertainty and confusion, a man begins to ask himself certain questions. How can one even begin to put into words something so um&#133; (trying to think of a word) <br>
							<br>
							
						FATHER-PRIEST: Enigmatic? <br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: No. <br>
							<br>
							
						FATHER-PRIEST: Vast? (he pronounces it as &quot;vost&quot;) <br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: No not vast (he pronounces it as &quot;vost&quot;) <br>
							<br>
							
						FATHER-PRIEST: Well whatever it is, basically you like the religion. <br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Yes. <br>
							<br>
							
						FATHER-PRIEST 2: Is there one aspect of the faith that you find particularly attractive? <br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (he thinks) I think the hats. The hat conveys that solemn religious look you want in a faith. Very pious. <br>
							<br>
							
						FATHER-PRIEST: Are you familiar with Orthodox theology? <br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Well perhaps, not to the extent that you are. But I know the basic plot. Yeah. <br>
							<br>
							
						FATHER-PRIEST: Plot? <br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Yes. You know the uh flood, and the uh lepers, and the commandments and all that. <br>
							<br>
							
						FATHER-PRIEST 2: Well it&#146;s obvious that you are sincere in your desire. <br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Oh yes I am Father. Incredibly sincere. So, uh, pffft, am I in? <br>
							<br>
							
						FATHER-PRIEST: The first step would be to familiarize yourself with these texts (brings out a pile of books). <br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Ah hah. You see Father, I&#146;m I&#146;m incredibly anxious to become a member. Um, don&#146;t you offer any kind of an express conversion? A quick change? <br>
							<br>
							
						(Sister Roberta enters)<br>
							<br>
							
						SISTER ROBERTA: Oh I&#146;m sorry. Father, there&#146;s a man waiting in the chapel. <br>
							<br>
							
						FATHER-PRIEST: You may attend to it Sister, oh this is George Costanza. He is interested in joining the church. <br>
							<br>
							
						SISTER ROBERTA: Oh are you? That&#146;s wonderful. Well good luck to you. <br>
							<br>
							
						(They bow back and forth; Sister Roberta leaves)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Nice nun. <br>
							<br>
							
						FATHER-PRIEST: No, Sister Roberta is not a nun. She is what we call a novice. <br>
							<br>
							
						FATHER-PRIEST 2: She won&#146;t be taking her final vows until next Thursday. <br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[In the chapel.]<br>
							<br>
							
						SISTER ROBERTA: May I help you? <br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Oh yeah, I&#146;m here to pick up my friend George Costanza. <br>
							<br>
							
						SISTER ROBERTA: Well he&#146;s in with the Father. <br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Oh yeah. <br>
							<br>
							
						SISTER ROBERTA: I&#146;m Sister Roberta. <br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Oh. Kramer. Pleasure. <br>
							<br>
							
						SISTER ROBERTA: Mine. (she smiles at Kramer) <br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[At Jerry&#146;s apartment.] <br>
							<br>
							
						(George and Jerry in the kitchen area; George is taking a small cake out of a box)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I can&#146;t believe how easy it is. I&#146;m virtually Orthodox. All I have to do is read a few books, memorize a few prayers, and I&#146;m in the club. <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: That&#146;s all there is to it. <br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: That&#146;s all there is to it. By Christmas day I will be Brother Costanza. <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: And when is Brother Costanza planning on telling Mother Costanza? <br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Brother Costanza will be taking the vow of silence. <br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer enters. He is flinging a slinky.) <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Oh a slinky.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Sister Roberta gave it to me. <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Why did she give you that? <br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: I think she liked me. <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What do you mean she liked you? <br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Liked me. <br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Kramer, they like everybody. They&#146;re friendly people. <br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: No. I think I picked up on a vibe. <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You picked up on a vibe, from a nun. <br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Yeah, Jerry I&#146;m telling you I have this power. And I have no control over it. <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yea alright. <br>
							<br>
							
						(ringing sounds from Kramer's apartment)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Oh, that's my phone.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer leaves. Jerry&#146;s girlfriend appears at the doorway.) <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Oh hi. <br>
							<br>
							
						TAWNI: Hi, I just wanted to stop by and see how you were feeling. <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (weakly) A little better. (fake cough) <br>
							<br>
							
						TAWNI: If you need anything let me know. <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Okay.<br>
							<br>
							
						TAWNI: Okay.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: All right.<br>
							<br>
							
						TAWNI: Bye.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Bye.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Tawni leaves; Jerry closes the door)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Story. <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: She&#146;s subletting Carol&#146;s place for a month. <br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Yea, she likes you. <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yeah but there&#146;s a problem. I found a tube of a fungicide in her medicine cabinet. <br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: So? <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: So I don&#146;t know what she&#146;s using it for. <br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Well how do you even know it&#146;s hers? Maybe it belonged to Carol. Did you see a name on the tube? <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I didn&#146;t even think to look. <br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Well take a look. It might not even belong to her. <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yeah. <br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: People always leave old things in their medicine cabinet. <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yeah I&#146;ve got this old bottle of cough medicine. <br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I still have brill cream. <br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[At Tawni&#146;s apartment. ]<br>
							<br>
							
						(Jerry knocks on the door )<br>
							<br>
							
						(knock, knock, knock) <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hi<br>
							<br>
							
						TAWNI: Hi. <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hi. Can I use your bathroom? <br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[At the doctor&#146;s apartment.] <br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: You sure you don&#146;t mind? <br>
							<br>
							
						DOCTOR: No of course not. People ask me medical questions all the time. <br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Well I mean the question isn&#146;t even for me it&#146;s for a friend. <br>
							<br>
							
						DOCTOR: Elaine, I&#146;m used to it. I&#146;m a doctor. <br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Well&#133; podiatrist. <br>
							<br>
							
						DOCTOR: Huh? <br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: No no, I&#146;m just saying you didn&#146;t really go to medical school, you went to podiatry school. Which I&#146;m sure is very grueling in it&#146;s own way. <br>
							<br>
							
						DOCTOR: I went to podiatry school because I like feet. I chose to work with feet. <br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I like feet too. I&#146;m just saying&#133; <br>
							<br>
							
						DOCTOR: Saying what? <br>

						(She knocks on the bathroom door.) <br>
							<br>
							
						(knock, knock, knock) <br>
							<br>
							
						TAWNI: How are you doing in there? <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Fine all done, just looking for the soap. <br>
							<br>
							
						(Jerry is looking around for the bottle of fungicide.) <br>
							<br>
							
						TAWNI: No soap? <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: No I don&#146;t see it. <br>
							<br>
							
						(Jerry finds the bottle of fungicide and picks it up. Jerry&#146;s girlfriend enters the bathroom with soap. Hastily, Jerry puts the bottle of fungicide in his pocket.) <br>
							<br>
							
						TAWNI: (giving Jerry the soap) Here you go. <br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[At George&#146;s parent&#146;s house.] <br>
							<br>
							
						(George is in the bathroom with his Latvian Orthodox books.) <br>
							<br>
							
						(knock, knock, knock) <br>
							<br>
							
						ESTELLE: George what are you doing in there? <br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: What? Nothing. <br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: You&#146;ve been in there an hour. <br>
							<br>
							
						ESTELLE: You don&#146;t feel well? <br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I&#146;m fine. <br>
							<br>
							
						ESTELLE: I want to know what you&#146;re doing in there. <br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Nothing. <br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: George, open the door. <br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: No. <br>
							<br>
							
						ESTELLE: Georgie. <br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: No! <br>

						[At Kramer&#146;s apartment.] <br>
							<br>
							
						(Sister Roberta is knocking on the door.) <br>
							<br>
							
						(knock, knock, knock) <br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Hey. <br>
							<br>
							
						SISTER ROBERTA: Good evening. I hope I&#146;m not disturbing you, but I found another toy I thought you might like. <br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[At Jerry&#146;s Apartment.] <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Okay, Latvius was the son of which apostle? And I&#146;ll need that in the form of a question. <br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I don&#146;t know. I can&#146;t believe they&#146;re making me take this test. <br>
							<br>
							
						(Elaine enters.) <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hey, did you talk to the doctor? <br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: No. <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: All right, the next time you see him show him this. (He presents the bottle of fungicide.) <br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: You took her medicine. <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Not on purpose. I was hoping there would be a name on the tube. When are you seeing him again? <br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I don&#146;t know. We got into this whole thing about how podiatrists aren&#146;t real doctors. <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: How could you say that? <br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: It&#146;s you fault. You just got me thinking. <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I was merely speaking extemporaneously. <br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I&#146;ve got nothing against the foot. I&#146;m pro-foot. <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Me too. <br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Do you think I should call him and apologize? <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yes. He&#146;s a doctor. (Elaine starts to leave. ) Wait a second. (Jerry puts the bottle of fungicide in Elaine&#146;s purse.) (to George) What are you doing? <br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: What does it look like I&#146;m doing? <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (Reading words George wrote on his hand) &quot;Matthew, Luke, Paul&quot;, what you&#146;re cheating on your conversion chest? <br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer enters.) <br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: I told you. <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What? <br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: I told you she liked me. <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Who? <br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Sister Roberta. <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: How do you know? <br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: She told me. She said she&#146;s never had a man stir up all of these feelings inside of her. She&#146;s questioning her faith. She&#146;s thinking of leaving the church. <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Wow<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Oh, uh, this power. I&#146;m dangerous Jerry, I&#146;m very very dangerous. <br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[At the priest&#146;s office.] <br>
							<br>
							
						FATHER-PRIEST: I must say George, I was somewhat surprised at the results of your conversion test. I don&#146;t recall having seen such an impressive performance. You truly must be filled with the spirit of the Lord. <br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Oh, I&#146;m I&#146;m full of it Father. <br>
							<br>
							
						FATHER-PRIEST 2: (muttering something to Father-Priest 1) &#133;(mumble)&#133; Kramer &#133;(mumble)&#133; <br>
							<br>
							
						FATHER-PRIEST: Yes, yes I see. (To George) I&#146;m sorry something has come up. <br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Oh, I understand. (George exits; Sees Kramer in the hallway) Hey.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: (rushed) Yea, Hey. (Kramer enters.) Um, you wanted to see me Father? <br>
							<br>
							
						FATHER-PRIEST: Yes. Please, sit down. Sister Roberta came to see me yesterday. <br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: I know what this is about Father. I didn&#146;t do anything. I just spoke to her innocently for just a few minutes. It&#146;s just that, that I have this power. <br>
							<br>
							
						FATHER-PRIEST: Yes. Kavorka. <br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Kavorka? <br>
							<br>
							
						FATHER-PRIEST: It is a Latvian word which means &quot;the lure of the animal&quot;. <br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: I don&#146;t understand. <br>
							<br>
							
						FATHER-PRIEST: Women are drawn to you. They would give anything to be possessed by you. <br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Help me Father. Help me. <br>
							<br>
							
						FATHER-PRIEST: Yes, yes I will help you. Listen very carefully. I want you to buy ten cloves of garlic, three quarts of vinegar, six ounces&#133; <br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[The hallway by Jerry&#146;s apartment]<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What is that stench? I got it. (He follows the smell to Kramer&#146;s door) Ah hah. <br>
							<br>
							
						(knock, knock, knock) <br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer opens his door. He is wearing a ring of garlics around his neck.) <br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Hey. <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hey. What are you doing? <br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: I&#146;ve got the Kavorka Jerry. <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: The Kavorka? What&#146;s that? <br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: The lure of the animal. I&#146;m dangerous. <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What is this thing around your neck? <br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: The priests they&#146;re helping me. I just bathed in vinegar. <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You know you&#146;re funcifying the whole building. <br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Keep away Jerry. Keep away. <br>
							<br>
							
						(He closes his door.) <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Kramer. (knock, knock, knock) Kramer. <br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[At the entrance of the church. There is a sign there. It reads: CONVERSION CEREMONY - FOR - GEORGE COSTANZA - 3:P.M. The sign is on a black background with white stick-on letters.]<br>
							<br>
							
						(A woman reads the sign.) <br>
							<br>
							
						WOMAN: George Costanza? Estelle&#146;s son? <br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[At George&#146;s parent&#146;s house.] <br>
							<br>
							
						ESTELLE: Latvian Orthodox? Why are you doing this? <br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: For a woman. <br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: A woman? What are you out of your mind? <br>
							<br>
							
						ESTELLE: Why can&#146;t you do anything like a normal person? <br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: Wait. Is this the group that goes around mutilating squirrels? <br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: No it&#146;s a regular religion. <br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: I&#146;m calling my lawyer. It might not be too late to get out of this. <br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I don&#146;t want to get out of it. <br>
							<br>
							
						ESTELLE: Bu George, you don&#146;t know what you&#146;re saying. You&#146;re under their control. <br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: What, they brainwashed you? <br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: No no. <br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: You&#146;re not performing any rituals in this house. <br>
							<br>
							
						ESTELLE: Go back to the psychiatrist. I beg you. <br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: And stay away from those squirrels. <br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[At Tawni&#146;s apartment.] <br>
							<br>
							
						TAWNI: Oh how you doing Jerry? <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Good. What&#146;s the matter? <br>
							<br>
							
						TAWNI: I&#146;m tired. I hardly slept last night with all this scratching. Bonkers was going crazy. <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Bonkers? <br>
							<br>
							
						TAWNI: My cat. He&#146;s got this weird sort of skin condition. Some type of fungus, I couldn&#146;t find his medicine. <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Oh it&#146;s your cat! <br>
							<br>
							
						TAWNI: What? <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Ooh, nothing. <br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[At the church.]<br>
							<br>
							
						FATHER-PRIEST: Are you ready my son? <br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Yes faddah. <br>
							<br>
							
						FATHER-PRIEST: What did you say? <br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: What? <br>
							<br>
							
						FATHER-PRIEST: I thought you said faddah. <br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I said faddah, I meant Father. Just a little bit nervous. <br>
							<br>
							
						FATHER-PRIEST: Ooh, of course.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Outside on a sidewalk.] <br>
							<br>
							
						(A woman is waiting for a cab. Kramer walks up to her.) <br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: How you doing? <br>
							<br>
							
						WOMAN: Get away from me you creep. (She walks away.) <br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Yes, Yes. It worked. Sister Roberta I&#146;ve still got time to catch her. <br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[At the church. It is George&#146;s conversion ceremony.] <br>
							<br>
							
						(Church music plays. George is dressed in a white church gown. He walks down the church aisle carrying a candle. Father-priest says some Latvian words. Kramer is running down the street going to the church. The church music is still playing. George takes a drink of some wine. He spills some on his gown. He makes a hand motion on his gown. Kramer is still running to the church.) <br>
							<br>
							
						FATHER-PRIEST: Congratulations George. Welcome to the faith. Sister Roberta would you please offer the final benediction. <br>
							<br>
							
						SISTER ROBERTA: (hesitates) I can&#146;t. (crowd murmurs) I&#146;m sorry. It&#146;s a beautiful religion, but I am not worthy of it. I found something else. <br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer enters the church.) <br>
							<br>
							
						SISTER ROBERTA: Him. <br>
							<br>
							
						CROWD: Kavorka, Kavorka. <br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[At Elaine&#146;s apartment.] <br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: (kiss, kiss) You know, because I love the foot. I&#146;m a big fan of the foot. <br>
							<br>
							
						DOCTOR: Well it&#146;s my fault. I got a little defensive. <br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: And that pinkie toe, come on . How adorable is the pinkie toe. <br>
							<br>
							
						DOCTOR: It&#146;s my favorite toe. <br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Let&#146;s face it, you get a bunion, where are you going? You&#146;re not going to the ear guy. <br>
							<br>
							
						DOCTOR: No you&#146;re not. <br>
							<br>
							
						(phone rings) <br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I&#146;ll be right back. <br>
							<br>
							
						DOCTOR: Oh uh, where&#146;s the bathroom? <br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: It&#146;s right down here to the left. I will uh meet you right back here. <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Elaine it&#146;s her cat. Her cat had the fungus. So I need the tube back. <br>
							<br>
							
						(The doctor is in Elaine&#146;s bathroom. He peeks into the medicine cabinet and finds the tube of fungicide.)<br>
							<br>
							
						DOCTOR: (Thinking to himself) &quot;Fungicide&quot;? Fungus? <br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[At the church]<br>
							<br>
							
						SISTER ROBERTA: Something&#146;s wrong. I don&#146;t feel the same lure. <br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: You don&#146;t? <br>
							<br>
							
						SISTER ROBERTA: What have I&#133;? I must return to the church. By the way you really need to take a bath. You stink. <br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Yeah yeah. <br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Closing Monologue]<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: But once you put medicine in your medicine cabinet you're never using it again. Any medicine you're using, is on the sink. It's not really even a medicine cabinet, it's really like an ointment museum isn't it? It's like here's a saff from 1983, some cream from the 70s. But you want to keep it private, because a medicine cabinet is a place that reveals our weaknesses and it can really throw off the balance between two people that might be going out. Somebody peeks in there, &quot;Oh I see Mr. Perfect needs tough actin' Tinactin. Well I guess I'll be calling the shots in this relationship from now on.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						[At Monk&#146;s]<br>
							<br>
							
						SASHA: For me? <br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Well I didn&#146;t do it for my mother. <br>
							<br>
							
						SASHA: I&#146;m really flattered. But I just don&#146;t feel ready to make a commitment yet. Maybe when I get back from Latvia. <br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Latvia? <br>
							<br>
							
						SASHA: Yes. I&#146;m going to stay with some relatives there for a year. Isn&#146;t it great? <br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Enjoy, enjoy. <br>
							<br>
							
						SASHA: Oh George, you are so sweet. Don&#146;t ever change. <br>
							<br>
							
						(She leaves)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I&#146;d like a doggie bag for this please. (hands her plate to the waitress)<br>
