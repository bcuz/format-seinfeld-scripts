KRAMER: (To Jerry) So how was the big trip?

JERRY: I don't want to talk about it!

KRAMER: (Observing Elaine's bandaged nose) Well, what happened to your nose?

ELAINE: I don't want to talk ab-ow!-t it! (She winces under the pain from her nose on the word 'about')

KRAMER: Well, you gotta give me something! Come on, how was the wedding? Was the bride radiant?

JERRY: Alright, I admit it. I slept with Nina, but that's all.

GEORGE: (Outraged) &quot;That's all&quot;?! That's everything! I don't know what all the rest of it is for anyway!

GEORGE: It's an expression.

ELAINE: (From the front of the room, she can hear George and Jerry's heated discussion) Hey! Shhhhh! (Crosses herself, then shakes her head - apologizing)

GEORGE: (Trying to whisper to Jerry) Look, we are gonna settle this right now! I demand reparations! I should get to sleep with Elaine. That's the only way to punish you!

JERRY: That doesn't punish me. It punishes Elaine! And cruelly, I might add.

GEORGE: (Losing it) Funny guy!

(Elaine quickly makes her way to Jerry and George, scattering flower petals as she goes -- she throws some at them)

ELAINE: Hey! Monkeys! Knock it off. My best friend is trying to get married up here!

GEORGE: Elaine, you have to sleep with me.

ELAINE: (Definite) I'm not gonna sleep with you.

GEORGE: Reparations!

ELAINE: Would you grow up, George?! What is the difference? Nina slept with him (Points to Jerry), he slept with me, I slept with Pinter. Nobody cares! It's all ancient history.

GEORGE: (Loud, so everyone at the wedding can hear) You slept with the groom?!

GEORGE: (Motioning toward waitress) I think she likes me.

JERRY: Sure.

GEORGE: So, how come nothing ever happened between you and Nina? (Getting paranoid) Is there a problem with her? Is she a man?

JERRY: Are you?

GEORGE: Well, what's the reason?

JERRY: We were too compatible Our conversations were so engrossing.

GEORGE: How engrossing?

JERRY: If we ever had a problem with Elaine, we could bring in Nina and not lose a step.

GEORGE: Wow! Heh. (Half kidding) You don't, huh, have a replacement lined up for me, do ya? heh he he he he he...

(Jerry snickers, then stares at George, smiling)

JERRY: Anyway, like I was saying, I couldn't make the transition from conversation to sex. There were no awkward pauses... I need an awkward pause.

GEORGE: I'm all for awkward pauses. Fix me up with her.. Wait a minute, Nina just saw me in my Timberlands! Now I have to wear them every time I see her.

JERRY: Why?

GEORGE: In any other shoe, I lose two inches. I - I can't have a drop down. We were eye to eye, I can't go eye to chin!

JERRY: So, you're gonna wear 'em no matter what the situation?

GEORGE: In every situation. No matter how silly I look. (Tastes his Clams Casino) Hm.. tastes a little funky.

END OF SHOW.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Just a side note -- "Sorry" vs "Sari" or "Saree"

The expression &quot;You can stuff your sorries in a sack&quot; is used throughout this episode (mainly by George, but also by Susan -- obviously Susan means it as &quot;sorry's&quot; -- You can stuff your sorry's in a sack&quot;

Since the episode also revolves around the trip to India, perhaps the writers of the episode are using the word "Sorry" and the Indian term "Sari" or "Saree" in a play on words -- A pun perhaps

The definition of "Sari" or "Saree" is:

Sari / Saree: A long piece of cotton or silk cloth, constituting the principal garment of Hindu women, worn round the waist, one end falling to the feet, and the other crossed over the bosom and shoulder, and sometimes over the head.

As they are in India, this would make sense, because you could literally &quot;stuff your Sarees in a sack&quot; -- so it is a play on words. Otherwise George would be saying &quot;You can stuff your "Sorry's" in a sack&quot; Like you have a sack stuffed full of &quot;apologys.&quot;

I think it's something to consider.
