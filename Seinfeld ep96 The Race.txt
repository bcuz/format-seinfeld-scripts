[Opening Monologue]

The Christmas tree certainly seems to inspire a love/hate relationship. All that time is spent selecting it and decorating it, and then a week after it's just thrown somewhere, you see it by the side of the road, it looks like a mob hit. A car slows down, a door opens and this tree just rolls out. People snap out of that Christmas spirit like it was a drunken stupor, they just wake up one morning and go, &quot;Oh my god, there's a tree inside the house! Just throw it anywhere!

JERRY: Ready to go Lois?

LOIS: Oh, Mr. Meyers this is my friend, Jerry.

DUNCAN: Jerry Seinfeld!

JERRY: Duncan Meyers!

LOIS: You two know each other?

DUNCAN: Yeah! We uh, went to High School together. Didn't we Jerry? Gee I hope you're not leaving now. We still have a lot of work left to do.

LOIS: Would you be able to come all the way downtown again in rush hour to pick me up?

JERRY: Well, I'd have to be Superman to do that Lois.

GEORGE: Your boyfriend reads the Daily Worker? What is he? A communist?

ELAINE: HE reads everything, you know, Ned's very well read.

GEORGE: Maybe he's just &quot;very well RED&quot;?

ELAINE: Communist? Don't you think he probably would have told me?

GEORGE: Well, does he wear bland, drab, olive colored clothing?

ELAINE: Yes, . . . yes he does dress a little drab.

GEORGE: Huh, he's a communist. . . . Look at this. &quot;Exciting uninhibited woman seeks forward thinking comrade and appearance not important.&quot; . . . Appearance Not Important! This is unbelievable. Finally this is an ideology I can embrace.
