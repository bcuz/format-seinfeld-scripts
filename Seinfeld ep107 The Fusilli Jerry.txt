[Opening Scene: Jerry and Elaine are outside, heading towards the apartment building]

JERRY: I hear you're going out with David Putty.

ELAINE: Yeah. What, is it a problem?

JERRY: Well, I think he could've asked me. Supposed to be a friend of mine.

ELAINE: Well, I guess he figured you just wouldn't care. It *has* been a few years.

JERRY: Elaine, you always care who an ex-girlfriend dates. You don't want it to be someone you know, and you don't want it to be someone better than you. Now, even though the latter is *obviously* impossible.

ELAINE: Oh, god.

JERRY: The former still applies. I don't know what it is, but I just can't see you with a mechanic.

ELAINE: Oh, yeah. Right, right. Well, all those mechanics do is work all day with their hands and their *big*, *muscular* arms on machines, and then they come home dripping with animal sexuality like Stanley Kowalski. What a huge turn-off that is.

JERRY: All right.


[At Monk's, George and Estelle are looking over their menus]

GEORGE: Look at that. They got lobster on the menu. Who would order a lobster here. I mean, do they bring a lobster in everyday hoping *todays* the day.

ESTELLE: So what if they have a lobster. Suddenly you're a shell-fish connoisseur.

GEORGE: You know, I think we really need to be in front of a television set. You take T.V. out of this relationship, it is *just* torture.

ESTELLE: So, I'm getting an eye job.

GEORGE: An eye job? Ma, you don't need an eye job.

ESTELLE: Georgie, I'm a divorcee.

GEORGE: No, you're not a divorcee. You&yuml;re just separated. You're---you're a separatee.

ESTELLE: Well, I'm out there, George.

GEORGE: No, you're not out there.

ESTELLE: I am, too!

GEORGE: You're not out there! You can't be, because *I* am out there. And if I see *you* out there, there's not enough voltage in this world to electroshock me back into coherence!

ESTELLE: Well, anyway, the operation is on Tuesday and I need you to drive me home because I'll be all drugged up.

GEORGE: Tuesday? I can't do it Tuesday. Steinbrenner needs me to run---

ESTELLE: This is the only time the doctor *has*.

(Kramer walks by their table on his way out)

GEORGE: Kramer, hey, hey! (Gets up out of his seat)

KRAMER: Hi, little buddy.

GEORGE: Come on over and sit down.

KRAMER: Hey, listen, I gotta go somewhere.

GEORGE: No, you're gonna sit down, you son of a gun...

KRAMER: All right, I'm sitting down. How are you? (Kisses Estelle on the cheek)

ESTELLE: So, Kramer. I'm getting an eye job.

KRAMER: Oh, yeah, good for you. Hey, you have to look your best. You're out there now.

GEORGE: She's not out there!

KRAMER: So, who is your doctor?

ESTELLE: Uh, Bakersoll.

KRAMER: (whistles). He's good. He's *very* good. He worked on this kid from Guatemala with no nose. Turned him into Ricardo Montalban.

GEORGE: Hey, Kramer, what are you doing Tuesday?

KRAMER: Tuesday? Uh...

GEORGE: Why doesn't *he* pick you up after the operation. He's got the car with the bench seats that you like.

ESTELLE: Oh, I don't care.

KRAMER: Yeah, I know, but I can't drive anybody anywhere until I go down to the motor vehicle bureau and get my new plates.

GEORGE: Well, giddy-up!


[At the motor vehicle bureau...]

KRAMER: Yeah, I'm here to pick up my new plates. My name is Kramer. Cosmo Kramer.

CLERK: Kramer.... (checks computer) All right...

KRAMER: All righty...

CLERK: Sign right here, please. (hands over clipboard)

KRAMER: (signs it) Okay. (The clerk hands him a manila envelope). Thanks. (opens up the envelope) Assman? Oh, no, these don't belong to me. I'm not the Assman. I think there's been a mistake.

CLERK: What's your name again?

KRAMER: Cosmo Kramer.

CLERK: (checks computer again) Cosmo Kramer. You *are* the Assman.

KRAMER: No! I'm not the Assman.

CLERK: Well, as far as the state of New York is concerned, you are.

(Failing to clear up the mistake, Kramer drives off with the new plates attached)


[Meanwhile, we join Elaine and David---in bed, I should add. David, who apparently looks satisfied, is still breathless. Elaine, on the other hand, is looking somewhat, preoccupied]

DAVID: How do you feel?

ELAINE: Fine.

DAVID: Something the matter?

ELAINE: No.

DAVID: Then what is it?

ELAINE: No, nothing.


[Later on, at Monk's, Jerry has just come in to meet Elaine. He joins her at the booth]

JERRY: Hi.

ELAINE: I was with David *Putty* last night.

JERRY: Yeah, so.

ELAINE: He did the move.

JERRY: What move?

ELAINE: You know...*the* move.

JERRY: Wait a second. *My* move?

(Elaine nods).

JERRY: David Putty used *my* move?

ELAINE: Yes, yes.

JERRY: Are you sure?

ELAINE: Jerry! There is no confusing *that* move with any other move.

JERRY: I can't believe it. He *stole* my move.

ELAINE: What else did you tell (reaches over to slap Jerry) him. (does it again) The two of you must have had *quite* a little chat!

JERRY: Oh, it wasn't like that! I didn't even mention you. You know, we were in the garage. You know how garages are. They're conducive to sex talk. It's a high-testosterone area.

ELAINE: Because of all the pistons and the lube jobs?

JERRY: Well, I'm going down to that garage and telling him to stop doing it.

ELAINE: Well, wait---wait a second.

JERRY: What?

ELAINE: Isn't that a little...rash?

JERRY: No! He stole my move!

ELAINE: Yeah, but...*I* like the move.

JERRY: Yeah, but it's like another comedian stealing my material.

ELAINE: Well, he doesn't even do it exactly the same. He--he--he uses a pinch at 

The End
