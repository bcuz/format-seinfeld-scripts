[Setting: Tim Whatley's apartment]

ELAINE: So.. Whatley's still Jewish, huh?

JERRY: Oh, sure. With out the parents, it's a breeze.

(Elaine laughs, Whatley enters)

TIM: Hey! Happy Chanukah!

JERRY: Hey, Tim. Great party.

(Tim holds up a mistletoe)

TIM: (Suggesting a kiss to Elaine) eh?

ELAINE: (Shrugging it off) eh.

TIM: (Accepting) Oh. (Turns to George) Hey, George, thanks again for getting me those Yankee tickets.

GEORGE: Oh, yeah. Still in good with the ground crew. (Laghs)

TIM: (Notices a woman walking by) Oh, hey, listen, I'd better circulate.. (moving over to the woman) Happy Chanukah, Tiffany! (they both move off camera)

ELAINE: This place is like Studio 54 with a menorah.

GEORGE: I'm gonna get some more of these kosher cocktail franks.. (leaves)

ELAINE: Oh.. (sees a guy looking at her) I got denim vest checking me out. (laughs) Fake phone number's coming out tonight.

JERRY: You have a standard fake?

ELAINE: Mm-hmm.

JERRY: (Notices an attractive woman walking by, starts to follow her) That's neat.

ELAINE: (Holds onto Jerry's arm) No, please! Denim vest! He's smoothing it! Jerry! God! (Jerry excapes Elaine's grasp, moves over to the woman. The man wearing a denim vest moves over to Elaine.)

DENIM VEST: Hi!

(Scene cuts to Jerry talking to the woman)

JERRY: Hi, I'm Jerry.

WOMAN: Hi. JERRY: You might not know it to look at me, but I can run really, really fast.

(Scene cuts to Elaine)

ELAINE: Nice vest. I like the.. big metal buttons

DENIM VEST: They're snaps. Listen, maybe we should, uh, go out some time?

ELAINE: Why don't I give you my phone number?


[Setting: Coffee Shop]

(George enters)

GEORGE: Hey.

JERRY: Hey! How'd it go with the cocktail franks?

GEORGE: Great! I ate the entire platter! Had to call in sick today.

JERRY: Didn't you call in sick yesterday?

GEORGE: Hey, I work for Kruger Industrial Smoothing: "We don't care, and it shows."

JERRY: (Notices George brought hhis mail) You're gonna open your mail here?

GEORGE: Hey, at least I'm bringing something to this. (Starts flipping through envelopes, reads one ) "Have you seen me?" (Flicks it aside) Nope. (looks at next envelope) Woah, something from Whatley.

JERRY: See? You give, and you get.

GEORGE: (Reading the card from Whatley) "This holiday season a donation has been made in your name to the Children's Alliance."?

JERRY: Oh, that's nice.

GEORGE: I got him Yankee's tickets! He got me a piece of paper saying "I've given your gift to someone else!"

JERRY: To a children's charity!

GEORGE: Don't you see how wrong that is?! Where's your Christmas spirit? And eye for an eye!

(Elaine enters)

ELAINE: Hey!

JERRY: Hey.

(Waitress moves tward the table)

ELAINE: (To waitress) Oh, nothing for me. (Waitress leaves) I'm going to "Atomic Sub" later.

JERRY: "Atomic Sub"? Why are you eating there?

ELAINE: I got a card, and they stamp it every time I buy a sub. 24 stamps, and I become a submarine (makes a gesture) captain.

JERRY: What does that mean?

ELAINE: (Embarrassed) Free sub.

(George lets out a depressed sigh while reading a card)

ELAINE: What?

GEORGE: Nothing. It's a card from my dad.

ELAINE: What is it? (Grabs the card from George, he tries to stop her, but fails. She reads it out loud.) "Dear son, Happy Festivus." What is Festivus?

GEORGE: It's nothing, stop it..

JERRY: When George was growing up..

GEORGE: (Interrupting) Jerry, No!

JERRY: His father..

GEORGE: No!

JERRY: Hated all the commercial and religious aspects of Christmas, so he made up his own holiday.

ELAINE: Ohhhh.. and another piece of the puzzle falls into place.

GEORGE: (pleading) Alright..

JERRY: And instead of a tree, didn't your father put up an aluminum pole?

(Elaine starts laughing uncontrollably - and continues to do so)

GEORGE: Jerry! Stop it!

JERRY: And weren't there a feats of strength that always ended up with you crying?

(Jerry joins in with Elaine's laughter)

GEORGE: I can't take it anymore! I'm going to work! ARe you happy now?! (Gathers his things, and runs out of the coffee shop. Elaine and Jerry laugh hysterically)


[Setting: Jerry's apartment]

(Elaine is digging into her purse)

ELAINE: Oh, I can't believe it! I've lost my "Atomic Sub" card!.. Oh no! I bet I wrote that fake number on the back of it when I gave it to denim vest!

JERRY: So?

ELAINE: I've eaten 23 bad subs, I just need 1 more! It's like a long, bad movie, but you want to see the end of it!

JERRY: No, you walk out.

ELAINE: Alright, then, it's like a boring book, but you gotta finish it.

JERRY: No, you wait for the movie!

ELAINE: (Irritated, and through clinched teeth) I want that free sub.

JERRY: You don't need the card. High-end hoagie outfit like that, it's all computerized! (Snaps) They're cloning sheep now.

KRAMER: (Correcting) No, they're not cloning sheep. It's the same sheep! I saw Harry Blackstone do that trick with two goats and a handkerchief on the old Dean Martin show!

JERRY: So, why don't you just try your blow-off number and see if he's called it?

ELAINE: That's a good idea.

(Kramer's cordless phone rings, startling him. He digs through his coat, and pulls it out of the pocket)

KRAMER: (Answering phone) Yeah, Go! Wha.. really? Yeah, ok. Yeah! Bye. (Hangs up) Great news! Yeah, the strike has been settled. I'm going back to work.

JERRY: What strike?

KRAMER: Yeah, H&H Bagels. That's where I worked.

JERRY: You?

ELAINE: Worked?

JERRY: Bagels?

KRAMER: Yeah. Look, see. I still have my business card. (Pulls it out, hands it to Elaine) Yeah, we've been on strike for 12 years.

ELAINE: Oh, I remember seeing those guys picketing out there, but I haven't seen them in a long time.

KRAMER: Yeah, well, H&H wouldn't let us use their bath room while we were picketing. It put a cramp on our solidarity.

ELAINE: What were your.. demands?

KRAMER: Yeah, 5.35 an hour. And that's what they're paying now.

ELAINE: I believe that's the new minimum wage.

KRAMER: Now you know who to thank for that!.. Alright, I've got to go. (Heads for the door)

JERRY: Why didn't you ever mention this?

KRAMER: Jerry, I didn't want you to know I was out of work. It's embarrassing! (Leaves) (Scene ends)


[Setting: H&H Bagel Shop]

(Kramer walks through the door)

KRAMER: All right, everybody! I'm back!

MANAGER: Who are you?

KRAMER: Cosmo Kramer.. strikes over.

MANAGER: Oh yeah! Kramer.

KRAMER: Huh.. wha- Didn't any of the guys come back?

MANAGER: NO, I"m sure they all got jobs.. like, ten years ago.

KRAMER: Oh, man. Makes you wonder what it was all for..

MANAGER: I could use someone for the holidays..

KRAMER: Alright! Toss me an apron, let's bagel! (Takes off his coat, puts it in the display case, then turns to see a plate full of bagels.) What are those?

MANAGER: Those are rasin bagels.

KRAMER: (Picks one up, he's mesmerized) I never thought I'd live to see that..


[Setting: Horse Track Betting]

(Elaine confronts two unattractive bookies)

ELAINE: So, anyway, I've been giving out your number as my standard fake.

BOOKIE: So. You're Elaine Benes. We've been getting calls fro you for 5 years.

ELAINE: So, listen, when this guy calls, if you could just give him my real number..

BOOKIE: (Interrupting) Hey, Charlie! Guess who's here. Elaine Benes.

(Co-Worker in the back speaks up)

CHARLIE: Elaine Benes?!

(Various other men in the line behind Elaine say the same thing)

BOOKIE: You make a lot of man friends. You know who's a man? Charlie here, he's a man. You know who else? Me. I'm a man.

CHARLIE: (faintly) I'm a man.

ELAINE: Ohh.. my..

BOOKIE: I'll have this best guy call your real number. You just, uh, give it to me. And that way, I'll have it. (Slides a pad over to Elaine so she can write it down)

ELAINE: My number? Ohh.. (looks at Kramer's business card) Okay.. Uh, well, there you go. (writes H&H's number down) And, uh, tell you what.. (looks at the board in the back) put a sawbuck on Captain Nemo in the third at Belmont.


[Setting: classy restaurant]

(Jerry and Tim Whatley meet)

TIM: Hey, Jerry.

JERRY: Hey, Tim.

TIM: What's up?

JERRY: Actually, I'm having dinner with a girl I met at your party.

TIM: Mazel Tov.

(Jerry's date, Gwen, arrives. She's completely unattractive)

GWEN: Jerry.. hi.

JERRY: Gwen?

GWEN: Yeah.

JERRY: (Not willing to believe how much uglier she is) Really?

GWEN: Yeah! Come on, our table is ready.

(Tim gives Jerry a face - almost like he feels sorry for Jerry)


[Setting: Jerry's apartment]

GEORGE: So, attractive one day - not attractive the next?

JERRY: Have you come across this?

GEORGE: Yes, I am familiar with this syndrome -- she's a two-face.

JERRY: (Relating) Like the Batman villain?

GEORGE: (Annoyed) If that helps you..

JERRY: So, if I ask her out again - I don't know who's showing up: The good, the bad, or the ugly.

GEORGE: (Identifying what Jerry said) Clint Eastwood!

JERRY: Yeah.

GEORGE: Hey, check this out. I gotta give out Christmas presents to everyone down at Kruger, so I'm pulling a Whatley. (Give a Christmas card to Jerry)

JERRY: (Reading it) "A donation has been made in your name to the Human Fund." - What is that?

GEORGE: (With pride) Made it up.

JERRY: (Continuing reading) "The Human Fund. Money for people."

GEORGE: What do you think?

JERRY: It has a certain understated stupidity.

GEORGE: (Once again, Identifying) The Outlaw of Josey Whales!

JERRY: ..Yeah.

(Enter Kramer)

(He is holding a sack full of bagels)

KRAMER: Ah, gentlemen.. bagels on the house!

JERRY: How was your first day?

KRAMER: Oh, fantastic! (Jerry and George both pick out a bagel) It felt so good to get my hands back in taht dough.

(Jerry and George stop before they take a bite from their bagels)

JERRY: Your hands were in the dough?

KRAMER: No, I didn't make these bagels. (Jerry and George both take a bite) Yeah, they're day-olds. The homeless won't even touch them. (Jerry and George stop eating) Oh, we try to fool them by putting a few fresh ones on top, but they dig.. they, they test.

(George spits his bagel out)

GEORGE: Alright. Uh, well, I'm out of here. (Gets up to leave)

JERRY: Happy Festivus!

KRAMER: What's Festivus?

JERRY: When George was growing up..

GEORGE: (Interrupting) No!

JERRY: His father..

GEORGE: Stop it! It's nothing. It's a stupid holiday my father invented. It doesn't exist!

(Elaine enters while George is exiting)

ELAINE: Happy Festivus, Georgie.

(George leaves yelling out "God!")

KRAMER: Frank invented a holiday? He's so prolific!

ELAINE: Kramer, listen, I got a little phone relay going, so, if a guy calls H&H and he's looking for me, you take a message.

JERRY: You're still trying to gget that free sub?

ELAINE: Hey! I have spent a lot of time, and I have eaten a lot of crap to get to where I am today. And I am NOT throwing it all away now.

JERRY: Is there a captain's hat involved in this?

ELAINE: Maybe.


[Setting: H&H Bagel Shop]

FRANK: Kramer, I got your message. I haven't celebrated Festivus in years! What is your interest?

KRAMER: Well, just tell me everything, huh?

FRANK: Many Christmases ago, I went to buy a doll for my son. I reach for the last one they had - but so did another man. As I rained blows opon him, I realized there had to be another way!

KRAMER: What happened to the doll?

FRANK: It was destroyed. But out of that, a new holiday was born. "A Festivus for the rest of us!"

KRAMER: That musta been some kind of doll.

FRANK: She was.


[Setting: Kruger Office Building]

(George is in the hallway, dispensing his made-up gifts)

GEORGE: Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas! (Co-worker gives a gift to George) Oh, Sandy! Here is a little something for you.. (hands her a card)

SANDY: (After reading the cheap gift, she's suddenly unimpressed) ..Oh.. thanks. (Walks off)

(George passes an open doorway)

GEORGE: Phil, I loved those cigars! Incoming! (Flicks his card tward Phil)

PHIL: Ow!

(George meets up with Kruger)

GEORGE: Aw, Mr. Kruger, Sir. Merry Christmas! (Hands him a card)

KRUGER: Not if you could see our books.. what's this?

GEORGE: The Human Fund.

KRUGER: Whatever. (Walks off)

GEORGE: Exactly. (Sees an off-camera co-worker) Erica!


[Setting: H&H Bagel Shop]

(Frank is still telling Kramer about Festivus)

FRANK: And at the Festivus dinner, you gather your family around, and you tell them all the ways they have disappointed you over the past year.

KRAMER: Is there a tree?

FRANK: No. Instead, there's a pole. It requires not decoration. I find tinsel distracting.

KRAMER: Frank, this new holiday of yours is scratching me right where I itch.

FRANK: Let's do it then! Festivus is back! I'll get the pole out of the crawl space. (Turns to leave, meets up with Elaine)

ELAINE: Hello, Frank.

FRANK: Hello, woman. (leaves)

ELAINE: Kramer! Kramer.. any word from the vest?

KRAMER: No. (To manager of H&H) Ah, listen, Harry, I need the 23rd off.

MANAGER: Hey! I hired you to work during the holidays. This is the holidays.

KRAMER: But it's Festivus.

MANAGER: What?

KRAMER: You know you're infringing on my right to celebrate new holidays..

MANAGER: That's not a right.

KRAMER: Well, it's going to be! Because I'm going back on strike. Come on Elaine. (Takes of his apron, and goes for his coat) It's a walk out!

ELAINE: No, I got to stay here and wait for the call.

KRAMER: What? You're siding with management?!

ELAINE: No, I just..

KRAMER: (Interrupting) Scab! Scab! (pointing at Elaine) Scab!


[Setting: Taxi Cab]

(Gwen joins Jerry in the cab. She's in her attractive state)

GWEN: Hey.

JERRY: Boy, am I glad to see you.

GWEN: You were expecting someone else?

JERRY: You never know.

GWEN: (To driver) You know, you might want to take the tunnel.

JERRY: So, uh, what do you feel like eating? Chinese or Italian?

(All the sudden, Gwen is extremely ugly)

GWEN: I can go either way.

JERRY: (Shocked) You're telling me.


[Setting: the Coffee Shop]

GEORGE: So, she was switching? Back and forth?

JERRY: Actually, the only place she always looked good was in that back booth over there.

GEORGE: So, just bring her here. This is all you really need.

JERRY: I can't just keep bringing her to the coffee shop. I mean, what if things, you know, progress?

GEORGE: Lights out.

JERRY: Alright, I'll give it a shot! I do really like this coffee shop. Nice cuff links, by the way.

GEORGE: (Pointing to them) Office Christmas gift. I tell you, this Human Fund is a gold mine!

JERRY: That's not a french cuff shirt, you know.

GEORGE: I know. I cut the button off and poked a hole with a letter opener.

JERRY: Oh, that's classy.

(Frank and Kramer enter. Frank is dragging an aluminum pole)

KRAMER: Well, Happy Festivus.

GEORGE: What is that? Is taht the pole?!

FRANK: George, Festivus is your heritage - it's part of who you are.

GEORGE: (Sulking) That's why I hate it.

KRAMER: There's a big dinner Tuesday night at Frank's house - everyone's invited.

FRANK: George, you're forgetting how much Festivus has meant to us all. I brought one of the casette tapes. (Franks pushes play, George as a child celebrating Festivus is heard)

FRANK: Read that poem.

GEORGE: (Complaining) I can't read it. I need my glasses!

FRANK: You don't need glasses, you're just weak! You're weak!

ESTELLE: Leave him alone!

FRANK: Alright, George. It's time for the feats of strength.

(George has a break down)

GEORGE: No! No! Turn it off! No feats of strength! (Gets up and starts running out of the coffee shop) I hate Festivus!

FRANK: We had some good times.

(Gwen walks in, and greets Jerry. She's in her unattractive state)

GWEN: Hey.

JERRY: I there. This is Kramer, and Frank.

GWEN: Hi.

KRAMER: (Shocked at her ugliness, he stammers) Hello.

GWEN: So, you ready to go?

JERRY: Uh, why don't we stay here? The back booth just opened up. (They both walk to the booth and sit down. Suddenly, Gwen is attractive) Now this is a good looking booth.


[Setting: H&H Bagel Shop]

(Kramer is picketing out side.)

KRAMER: Protect Festivus! Hey, no bagels, no bagels, no bagels, (Continues to chant)

(Cut to inside the store)

MANAGER: (To a waiting Elaine) Lady, if you want a sandwich, I'll make you a sandwich.

ELAINE: (Whining) I want the one that I earned. (Phone rings) I'll get it. I'll get it! (Into phone) H&H, and Elaine.

KRAMER: (From a phone booth right outside the store) Elaine, you should get out of there. I sabotaged the bagel machine last night. It's going down.

ELAINE: What did you do?

KRAMER: You've been warned.

(Elaine looks out the window, and sees Kramer at the pay phone)

ELAINE: Oh, hi! (Waves at him)

(Steam starts coming from a pipe on the machine. Elaine hangs up)

WORKER: Hey, the steam valve's broke.

MANAGER: Can we still make bagels?

WORKER: Sure. It's just a little steamy.

(Kramer knocks on the shop door)

KRAMER: Hey! How do you like your bagels now?!

(No one inside seems to care. Kramer waits by the door to see if anyone was affected)


[Setting: Kruger Building]

KRUGER: George, I got something for you. (Pulls a check from his pocket) I'm suppose to find a charity and throw some of the company's money at it. They all seem the same to me, so, what's the difference? (Hands the check to George)

GEORGE: 20 thousand dollars?

KRUGER: Made out to the Human Fund. (Tries to enter his office, but it's locked) Oh, damn. I've locked myself out of my office again. Oh well. I'm going home.


[Setting: Coffee Shop]

GWEN: Jerry, how many times do we have to come to this.. place?

JERRY: Why? It's our place.

GWEN: I just found a rubber band in my soup.

JERRY: Oh.. I know who's cooking today!

(Enter George)

GEORGE: Hey! Surprise, surprise!

JERRY: Hey, Georgie!

GWEN: I think I'm just gonna go.

JERRY: I'll be here.

(Gwen leaves)

GEORGE: (Sees Gwen's meal) Hey, soup.

JERRY: She didn't touch it.

(George spoons through his soup, and finds a rubber band)

GEORGE: Ohh.. Paco! (Flicks rubber band tward the kitchen) Hey, take a look at this. (Hands Jerry Kruger's check)

JERRY: 20 thousand dollars from Kruger? You're not keeping this.

GEORGE: I don't know.

JERRY: Excuse me?

GEORGE: I've been doing a lot of thinking. This might be my chance to start giving something back.

JERRY: You want to give something back? Start with the 20 thousand dollars.

GEORGE: I'm serious.

JERRY: You're going to start your own charity?

GEORGE: I think I could be a philanthropist. a kick ass philanthropist! I would have all this money, and people would love me. Then they would come to me.. and beg! And if I felt like it, I would help them out. And then they would owe me big time! (Thinking to himself) .. First thing I'm gonna need is a driver..


[Setting: Outside H&H Bagels]

(Kramer is chanting 'no bagels, no bagels..' Elaine walks out, her make-up is distorted, and her face is pale because of the steam)

ELAINE: Kramer, the vest just called.

KRAMER: (Shocked by the way Elaine looks) Yama - Hama! It's fright night!

ELAINE: Oh, yeah, I got a little steam bath. Listen, in 10 minutes, I'm gonna have my hands on that "Atomic Sub" card.

KRAMER: And?

ELAINE: (Embarrassed) Free sub. (Starts to leave) I'll see ya.

KRAMER: Yeah.

(Gwen walks by, she's in her ugly state)

GWEN: Kramer, Hi!

KRAMER: Oh, hello.

GWEN: It's Gwen.. We met .. at the coffee shop.

KRAMER: Ah-huh.

GWEN: I'm dating your friend, Jerry..

KRAMER: Ahh.. I don't know who you really are, but I've seen Jerry's girlfriend, and she's not you. You're much better looking - and like, a foot taller.

GWEN: That's why we're always hiding in that coffee shop! He's afraid of getting caught.

KRAMER: Oh, he's a tomcat.

(Cut to Elaine)

(She meets up with Denim Vest on the street corner)

ELAINE: Steve.

DENIM VEST: Hmm?

ELAINE: It's Elaine.

DENIM VEST: From Tim Whatley's party?

ELAINE: Yeah.

DENIM VEST: You look.. different.

ELAINE: I see you're still sticking with the denim. (He's wearing a denim coat) Do you have that card that I gave you?

DENIM VEST: Well, I had it back at my place, but I can't go there now.. I'll give it to you later, or something.

ELAINE: No, no, no. You give me your number.

DENIM VEST: Okay. Sure. (Pulls out a pad, and starts writing a number down) Do you have the mumps?

ELAINE: No.

DENIM VEST: Typhoid?

ELAINE: No.

DENIM VEST: (Hands her the paper, and runs off) Yama - Hama!

(Elaine looks at the number, and sees it's the same as the number on a nearby truck)

ELAINE: A fake number! Blimey!


[Setting: Kruger's office]

KRUGER: George, we have a problem. There's a memo, here, from accounting telling me there's no such thing as the Human Fund.

GEORGE: Well, there could be.

KRUGER: But there isn't.

GEORGE: Well, I - I could, Uh, I could give the money back. Here. (Holds it out)

KRUGER: George, I don't get it. If there's no Human Fund, those donation cards were fake. You better have a damn good reason why you gave me a fake Christmas gift.

GEORGE: Well, sir, I - I gave out the fake card, because, um, I don't really celebrate Christmas. I, um, I celebrate Festivus.

KRUGER: Vemonous?

GEORGE: Festivus, Sir. And, uh, I was afraid that I would be persecuted for my beliefs. They drove my family out of Bayside, Sir!

KRUGER: Are you making all this up, too?

GEORGE: Oh, no, Sir. Festivus is all too real. And.. I could prove it - if I had to.

KRUGER: Yeah, you probably should.


[Setting: The Costanza's house]

GEORGE: Happy Festivus!

FRANK: George? This is a surprise. (Looking at Kruger) Who's the suit?

GEORGE: Yo, dad. This is my boss, Mr. Kruger.

FRANK: Have you seen the pole, Kruger?

GEORGE: Dad, he doesn't need to see the pole.

FRANK: He's gonna see it.

(Enter Jerry and Elaine. Elaine is still ugly from the steam)

GEORGE: Happy Festivus! (Sees Elaine) Yama - Hama!

ELAINE: I didn't have time to go home. What are you doing here?

GEORGE: Embracing my roots.

JERRY: They nailed you on the 20 G's?

GEORGE: Busted cold.

(Cut to Kruger and Frank)

(They're looking at the Festivus pole)

FRANK: It's made from aluminum. Very high strength-to-weight ratio.

KRUGER: I find your belief system fascinating.

(Enter Kramer)

(Kramer's with the two bookies from Horse Track Betting)

KRAMER: Hey! Happy Festivus, everyone! (Hugs George, and jumps up and down) Hee, hee, hee!

BOOKIE: Hello again, Miss Benes.

ELAINE: What are you doing here?

BOOKIE: Damnedest thing.. me and Charlie were calling to ask you out, and, uh, we got this bagel place..

KRAMER: (Finishing the story) I told them I was just about to see you.. It's a Festivus miracle!

(Estelle comes through the kitchen door, hitting Kramer as she opens it)

ESTELLE: Dinner's ready!

FRANK: Let's begin.

(Everyone sits around the table. Kruger recognized Kramer from "The Meat Slicer" episode..) KRUGER: Dr.. Van Nostrand?

KRAMER: Uh.. that's right.

(Cut to Frank)

FRANK: Welcome, new comers. The tradition of Festivus begins with the airing of grievances. I got a lot of problems with you people! And now you're gonna hear about it! You, Kruger. My son tells me your company stinks!

GEORGE: Oh, God.

FRANK: (To George) Quiet, you'll get yours in a minute. Kruger, you couldn't smooth a silk sheet if you had a hot date with a babe.. I lost my train of thought.

(Frank sits down, Jerry gives a face that says "That's a shame". Gwen walks in)

GWEN: Jerry!

JERRY: Gwen! How'd you know I was here?

GWEN: Kramer told me.

KRAMER: Another Festivus miracle!

(Jerry gives Kramer a death stare. He shuts up. Gwen notices Elaine)

GWEN: I guess this is the ugly girl I've been hearing about.

ELAINE: Hey, I was in a shvitz for 6 hours. Give me a break.

(Gwen leaves, Jerry follows)

JERRY: Gwen. Gwen, wait! Ah! (runs back to his seat) Bad lighting on the porch.

ELAINE: (To bookie) Hey, how'd my horse do?

BOOKIE: He had to be shot.

FRANK: And now as Festivus rolls on, we come to the feats of strength.

GEORGE: Not the feats of strength..

FRANK: This year, the honor goes to Mr. Kramer.

KRAMER: Uh-oh. Oh, gee, Frank, I'm sorry. I gotta go. I have to work a double shift at H&H.

JERRY: I thought you were on strike?

KRAMER: Well, I caved. I mean, I really had to use their bathroom. Frank, no offence, but this holiday is a little (makes a series of noises) out there.

GEORGE: Kramer! You can't go! Who's gonna do the feats of strength?

(Exit Kramer)

KRUGER: (Sipping liquor from a flask) How about George?

FRANK: Good thinking, Kruger. Until you pin me, George, Festivus is not over!

GEORGE: Oh, please, somebody, stop this!

FRANK: (Taking off his sweater) Let's rumble!

(Cuts to an outside view of the Costanza's house)

ESTELLE: I think you can take him, Georgie!

GEORGE: Oh, come on! Be sensible.

FRANK: Stop crying, and fight your father!

GEORGE: Ow! .. Ow! I give, I give! Uncle!

FRANK: This is the best Festivus ever!


[Setting: H&H Bagel Shop]

(Kramer is shaping some dough and chewing gum - his gum falls into the dough. He starts looking for the gum, and starts extracting it from the dough. The manger is watching)

MANAGER: Alright. That's enough. You're fired.

KRAMER: Thank - you! (Gets his coat, and leaves)


The End
