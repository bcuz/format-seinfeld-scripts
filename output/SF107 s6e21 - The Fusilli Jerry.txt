[Opening Scene: Jerry and Elaine are outside, heading towards the apartment building]

JERRY: I hear you're going out with David Putty.

ELAINE: Yeah. What, is it a problem?

JERRY: Well, I think he could've asked me. Supposed to be a friend of mine.

ELAINE: Well, I guess he figured you just wouldn't care. It *has* been a few years.

JERRY: Elaine, you always care who an ex-girlfriend dates. You don't want it to be someone you know, and you don't want it to be someone better than you. Now, even though the latter is *obviously* impossible.

ELAINE: Oh, god.

JERRY: The former still applies. I don't know what it is, but I just can't see you with a mechanic.

ELAINE: Oh, yeah. Right, right. Well, all those mechanics do is work all day with their hands and their *big*, *muscular* arms on machines, and then they come home dripping with animal sexuality like Stanley Kowalski. What a huge turn-off that is.

JERRY: All right.


[At Monk's, George and Estelle are looking over their menus]

GEORGE: Look at that. They got lobster on the menu. Who would order a lobster here. I mean, do they bring a lobster in everyday hoping *todays* the day.

ESTELLE: So what if they have a lobster. Suddenly you're a shell-fish connoisseur.

GEORGE: You know, I think we really need to be in front of a television set. You take T.V. out of this relationship, it is *just* torture.

ESTELLE: So, I'm getting an eye job.

GEORGE: An eye job? Ma, you don't need an eye job.

ESTELLE: Georgie, I'm a divorcee.

GEORGE: No, you're not a divorcee. You&yuml;re just separated. You're---you're a separatee.

ESTELLE: Well, I'm out there, George.

GEORGE: No, you're not out there.

ESTELLE: I am, too!

GEORGE: You're not out there! You can't be, because *I* am out there. And if I see *you* out there, there's not enough voltage in this world to electroshock me back into coherence!

ESTELLE: Well, anyway, the operation is on Tuesday and I need you to drive me home because I'll be all drugged up.

GEORGE: Tuesday? I can't do it Tuesday. Steinbrenner needs me to run---

ESTELLE: This is the only time the doctor *has*.

(Kramer walks by their table on his way out)

GEORGE: Kramer, hey, hey! (Gets up out of his seat)

KRAMER: Hi, little buddy.

GEORGE: Come on over and sit down.

KRAMER: Hey, listen, I gotta go somewhere.

GEORGE: No, you're gonna sit down, you son of a gun...

KRAMER: All right, I'm sitting down. How are you? (Kisses Estelle on the cheek)

ESTELLE: So, Kramer. I'm getting an eye job.

KRAMER: Oh, yeah, good for you. Hey, you have to look your best. You're out there now.

GEORGE: She's not out there!

KRAMER: So, who is your doctor?

ESTELLE: Uh, Bakersoll.

KRAMER: (whistles). He's good. He's *very* good. He worked on this kid from Guatemala with no nose. Turned him into Ricardo Montalban.

GEORGE: Hey, Kramer, what are you doing Tuesday?

KRAMER: Tuesday? Uh...

GEORGE: Why doesn't *he* pick you up after the operation. He's got the car with the bench seats that you like.

ESTELLE: Oh, I don't care.

KRAMER: Yeah, I know, but I can't drive anybody anywhere until I go down to the motor vehicle bureau and get my new plates.

GEORGE: Well, giddy-up!


[At the motor vehicle bureau...]

KRAMER: Yeah, I'm here to pick up my new plates. My name is Kramer. Cosmo Kramer.

CLERK: Kramer.... (checks computer) All right...

KRAMER: All righty...

CLERK: Sign right here, please. (hands over clipboard)

KRAMER: (signs it) Okay. (The clerk hands him a manila envelope). Thanks. (opens up the envelope) Assman? Oh, no, these don't belong to me. I'm not the Assman. I think there's been a mistake.

CLERK: What's your name again?

KRAMER: Cosmo Kramer.

CLERK: (checks computer again) Cosmo Kramer. You *are* the Assman.

KRAMER: No! I'm not the Assman.

CLERK: Well, as far as the state of New York is concerned, you are.

(Failing to clear up the mistake, Kramer drives off with the new plates attached)


[Meanwhile, we join Elaine and David---in bed, I should add. David, who apparently looks satisfied, is still breathless. Elaine, on the other hand, is looking somewhat, preoccupied]

DAVID: How do you feel?

ELAINE: Fine.

DAVID: Something the matter?

ELAINE: No.

DAVID: Then what is it?

ELAINE: No, nothing.


[Later on, at Monk's, Jerry has just come in to meet Elaine. He joins her at the booth]

JERRY: Hi.

ELAINE: I was with David *Putty* last night.

JERRY: Yeah, so.

ELAINE: He did the move.

JERRY: What move?

ELAINE: You know...*the* move.

JERRY: Wait a second. *My* move?

(Elaine nods).

JERRY: David Putty used *my* move?

ELAINE: Yes, yes.

JERRY: Are you sure?

ELAINE: Jerry! There is no confusing *that* move with any other move.

JERRY: I can't believe it. He *stole* my move.

ELAINE: What else did you tell (reaches over to slap Jerry) him. (does it again) The two of you must have had *quite* a little chat!

JERRY: Oh, it wasn't like that! I didn't even mention you. You know, we were in the garage. You know how garages are. They're conducive to sex talk. It's a high-testosterone area.

ELAINE: Because of all the pistons and the lube jobs?

JERRY: Well, I'm going down to that garage and telling him to stop doing it.

ELAINE: Well, wait---wait a second.

JERRY: What?

ELAINE: Isn't that a little...rash?

JERRY: No! He stole my move!

ELAINE: Yeah, but...*I* like the move.

JERRY: Yeah, but it's like another comedian stealing my material.

ELAINE: Well, he doesn't even do it exactly the same. He--he--he uses a pinch at the end instead of the *swirl*!

JERRY: Oh, yeah. The pinch. *I've* done the pinch. That's not new. Besides which, I don't know how you could trust any of his moves now. His whole *repertoire* could be lifted.

ELAINE: You know, it's strange, because he's such an honest mechanic.

JERRY: I know, he's probably the only honest mechanic in New York.


[Later, Jerry and George are outside, where Jerry has just bought a candy bar at the newsstand]

JERRY: ...so he stole my move and he's using it on Elaine.

GEORGE: You told David Putty your move and you didn't tell *me*? I *need* a move. You know I have no moves, Jerry. (points to the candy bar) Gimme a bite.

JERRY: Can I just get it opened first?

GEORGE: I can't believe you're hoarding sex moves. I'm out there rubbing two sticks together. You walk around with a zippo.

JERRY: All right, all right. Here. (hands George a piece of the candy bar).

GEORGE: (takes a bite) Oh, that's good. That's very good.

JERRY: You feel better?

GEORGE: Yeah, much better. All right, so what's the move, because I need *something*. This woman I'm dating, it's like she's doing her nails during love-making.

JERRY: Nancy Klopper?

GEORGE: Yeah. Never seen anyone so bored. I'm working like a dog here. Give me a moan. *Something*. I'd settle for a belch, for god's sake. All right, come on, let's have it.

JERRY: All right, George. I'm gonna tell you. But I just wanna make sure, before---

GEORGE: Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's in the vault. I'm putting it in the vault.

JERRY: It's not even a question of that. The point is when something like this is passed along, one must be certain that it's going to be used in a *conscientious* way. This is not some parlor trick to be used---

GEORGE: You're gonna tell me...or not.

JERRY: All right. On your bed. You got a headboard? You'll need a headboard.

GEORGE: I got a headboard.

JERRY: Is it padded?

GEORGE: No.

JERRY: Good. How tall is she?

GEORGE: Five-foot four. Why?

JERRY: You can't have more than a one-foot differential in your heights. Otherwise, you could really hurt your neck.

GEORGE: I can't tell ya how much I appreciate this.

JERRY: George, if you could master this, you'll never be alone again.


[Back at Jerry's apartment: Jerry and George have just walked in, still conversing on the same subject]

JERRY: Now, the ending is kind of an option. I use the swirl. I like the swirl. I'm comfortable with the swirl. *I* feel the swirl is a great capper. He uses the pinch, which I find a little presumptuous.

GEORGE: Is it a clockwise swirl?

JERRY: I prefer clockwise, but it's not written in stone.

(Kramer enters, holding an object of some kind).

KRAMER: Here you go, buddy. (shows it to Jerry).

JERRY: What is it?

KRAMER: *Fusilli* Jerry! It's made from Fusilli pasta. See the microphone?

JERRY: When did you do this?

KRAMER: In my spare time. (turns to George). You know, I'm working on one of you, George. I'm using ravioli. See, the hard part is to find a pasta that captures the individual.

JERRY: Oh... Why Fusilli?

KRAMER: Because *you're* silly. Get it? (hands the Fusilli to Jerry) Yeah...

JERRY: Well, thank you very much.

GEORGE: So, did you get your new plates?

KRAMER: Oh...yeah. I got my new plates. But they mixed them up. Somebody got mine and I got their *vanity* plates.

GEORGE: What do they say?

KRAMER: Assman.

JERRY: Assman?

KRAMER: Yeah. Assman, Jerry. I'm Cosmo Kramer, the Assman!

JERRY: Who would order a license plate that says "Assman"?

GEORGE: Maybe they're Wilt Chamberlain's.

JERRY: It doesn't have to be someone who gets a lot of women. It could be just some guy with a big ass.

KRAMER: Yeah, or it could be a proctologist.

JERRY: Yeah. Proctologist.

GEORGE: Come on! No doctor would put that on his car.

KRAMER: Have you ever *met* a proctologist? Well, they usually have a very good sense of humor. You meet a proctologist at a party, don't walk away. *Plant* yourself there, because you will hear the funniest stories you've ever heard. See, no one wants to admit to them that they *stuck* something up there. Never! It's always an accident. Every proctologist story ends in the same way: "It was a million to one shot, Doc. Million to one."

(A phone rings in the distant)

KRAMER: Oh! There's my phone. (He leaves)

GEORGE: So, where you gonna stick this (points to the Fusilli Jerry)

JERRY: I'll tell you where I'd like to stick it.


[We cut to the garage where David Putty is working on a car. Jerry walks in]

JERRY: Hey, David.

DAVID: Oh, hi, Jerry.

JERRY: Hey, what's the story? I hear you're doing my move.

DAVID: What move?

JERRY: What move? *My* move. The one I told you about. You used it on Elaine.

DAVID: You're move? What, are you kidding? I was doing that before I knew you. All you told me about was the ending.

JERRY: The ending is the whole thing. Without the ending, it's nothing. You had *nothing*.

DAVID: Oh, that ending was *so* obvious. I would have figured it out anyway. I didn't need you to tell me that stupid twist.

JERRY: Swirl.

DAVID: Whatever. I don't even do it.

JERRY: Oh, yeah, I know. You do the *pinch*.

DAVID: Yeah, that's right.

JERRY: You can't come up with your own stuff , so you *steal* other peoples? You're nothing but a hack.

DAVID: Are you through, 'cuz, uh, I gotta get back to work.

JERRY: Well, I'll tell you what I'll do, you know. If you wanna do it out of town...okay. But not in the city.

DAVID: All right, how about the next time your car breaks down, you take *that* out of town.

JERRY: Fine.

DAVID: Good!


[While driving, Jerry hits a pothole and his car is now making a clanking noise]


[We join George and Nancy, who are....getting busy under the covers.]

NANCY: Ow, George! (crawls out from beneath the covers) What are you doing?

GEORGE: (pops his head out of the covers, looking a bit confused) Uh...you know, uh...pleasuring you.

NANCY: Well, stop it!

GEORGE: You don't like the move?

NANCY: No. I don't.

GEORGE: You're kidding.

NANCY: No, I'm not. It feels like aliens poking at my body.

GEORGE: Sorry. I'll just go back to my usual routine.


[Back to Elaine and David in the middle of, uh...you know...]

ELAINE: Oh, god! Oh, god, Dave! Oh, yes! Yes!

DAVID: No, I'm sorry.

ELAINE: What?!!

DAVID: I can't do the move.

ELAINE: What?

DAVID: Oh, he's ruined it for me.

ELAINE: Oh, oh, come on, please?

DAVID: No, he called me a hack. I'm just not into doing it anymore.

ELAINE: Oh, so---so that's it?

DAVID: I'll come up with some new stuff.


[Cut to Kramer heading towards his car. He picks up a note on his windshield and reads it...]

KRAMER: "Call me. Thirty-six, twenty-four, forty-six. I think I have what you're looking for." (Pleased by the note, Kramer stumbles into his car).

(Meanwhile, Estelle is at Dr. Bakersoll's office)

DR. BAKERSOLL: I must caution you about one thing. You can't cry for at least ten day. You can ruin the operation.

ESTELLE: Oh, okay.

DR. BAKERSOLL: Now, is someone coming to pick you up?

ESTELLE: Yes, my son's friend should be here any minute.


[In the parking lot just outside, Kramer has pulls into a "Doctors Only" space]

SECURITY GUARD: Can I help you?

KRAMER: Ah, yeah. Doctor Cosmo Kramer. (points to plate) Proctology.

SECURITY GUARD: Oh, oh, okay. Sure...

KRAMER: Thanks. Have a good day.


[Kramer is driving Estelle home]

KRAMER: I just can't get over how fantastic you look.

ESTELLE: Oh, really?

KRAMER: Oh, yeah. This takes twenty years off.

ESTELLE: And it was all done by laser. I don't even need bandages.

(As a car passes Kramer, someone yells out, "Yo, Assman! Look at the Assman!" Kramer waves).

ESTELLE: Did he say "Assman"?

KRAMER: Oh, yeah.

ESTELLE: Oh my goodness.

(Another car passes: "Hey, the Assman's in town!")

KRAMER: You got that straight!

ESTELLE: Boy. I never dreamed it could make such a difference.

(Kramer makes a sudden stop, and in a protective gesture, he sticks his arm out in front of Estelle.)


[Back to Jerry's apartment]

JERRY: You must have done *something* wrong. You probably screwed up the order. Did you close with the swirl?

GEORGE: Supposed to close with the swirl?

JERRY: Oh my god. Yes, you close with the swirl. There's a progression there. I told you to write it down.

GEORGE: Yeah, yeah, should've written it down.

(Bzzz. Jerry walks over to answer it)

JERRY: Yeah?

BUZZER: Elaine.

JERRY: C'mon up. (turns to George) You know what? Do me a favor. Don't even do the move anymore. You're gonna give it a bad name.

(The phone rings)

JERRY: Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. What? Twenty-eight hundred dollars?!! That's the estimate on my car?!! No, don't even do anything. I'm gonna think about it. Okay, bye.

GEORGE: What's to think about? If Putty says it's what it is, it's what it is. He's not gonna cheat you.

JERRY: Except that it's not Putty.

GEORGE: What happened to Putty?

JERRY: Eh, we had a little fight about the move. I took her to this other place. I think they might be trying to screw me.

GEORGE: Well, of course they're trying to screw you. What do you think? That's what they do. They can make up anything. Nobody knows. "By the way, you need a new Johnson rod in there." "Oh, a Johnson rod. Yeah, well, you better put one of those on."

(Elaine comes in looking a bit peeved)

JERRY: Hey, Elaine.

ELAINE: Yeah, yeah, hello.

JERRY: Is it something I said?

ELAINE: Yes! As a matter of fact! David Putty won't do the move anymore.

JERRY: Really?

ELAINE: Oh, he's come up with some other move. You should see this thing.

JERRY: What is it?

ELAINE: Oh, it's a lot of just fancy-shmancy stuff. You know what it's like? It's like a big budget movie with a story that goes *nowhere*.

JERRY: Huh.

ELAINE: I mean, this move is no good, Jerry. It's just taking up a lot of my time. And I...will not stand by and allow him to perform this move on me, when a perfectly good move is just sitting in the barn doing nothing!

GEORGE: Let me ask you a question. This new move. Is there a knuckle involved in any way?

ELAINE: Yes. As a matter of fact, there is.

GEORGE: I think that's mine.

ELAINE: I'm not surprised.

JERRY: Listen. I need you to do me a favor. When's the next time you're gonna see him?

ELAINE: Why?

JERRY: You gotta get an estimate on my car from him. I think this garage is trying to screw me.

ELAINE: An estimate? How am I supposed to do that?

JERRY: Well, look. Here's the work order with everything that broke. Just kind of bring it up at the right time and find out. (hands Elaine the work order)

ELAINE: (takes the work order and points to the Fusilli Jerry sitting on the table) What? What is this?

JERRY: That's, uh, Fusilli Jerry.

ELAINE: Fusilli Jerry?

JERRY: Yeah. Kramer made it.

GEORGE: All right, listen, I'll see you guys later.

(As George is leaving, Kramer comes in with a female companion)

JERRY: Hey, Assman!

KRAMER: Hey, well, this is Sally.

SALLY: Hello.

JERRY: Hi.

ELAINE: Hi.

KRAMER: Shall we go?

SALLY: Okay. (turns around and walks out with an exaggerated swing of her hips)

(Elaine, Jerry, and George make a face)


[Back at the Costanzas' house...]

ESTELLE: You can't face the fact that I'm improving myself.

FRANK: You're not the only one improving yourself. I worked out with a dumbbell yesterday. I feel *vigorous*.

ESTELLE: Just take your mail and go home. I have things to do.

FRANK: I got things to do, too.

ESTELLE: Don't upset me! I can't cry!

FRANK: Getting an eye job like some Manhattanite, huh?

ESTELLE: Well, it's already working. Kramer made a pass at me.

FRANK: Kramer made a pass at you? You're crazy.

ESTELLE: I'm not crazy. He stopped short and made a grab.

FRANK: He stopped short? That's my move. I'm gonna kill him!


[Once again, we join Elaine and David...in bed as usual...doing what they do best]

ELAINE: Hey, let me ask you a question.

DAVID: Sure.

ELAINE: What do you charge for blown shocks?

DAVID: What?

ELAINE: Two, three hundred?

DAVID: I don't know. Maybe five hundred.

ELAINE: Ah.

(They go back to kissing)

ELAINE: What about a bad gasket?

DAVID: Bad gasket?

ELAINE: Yeah. Like a terrible gasket.

DAVID: What is all this?

ELAINE: Nothing, nothing. I'm just taking an interest in what you...do.

DAVID: What kind of car is it?

ELAINE: Oh...any kind of---of a Swedish car.

DAVID: All together, that could run about sixteen hundred.

ELAINE: Oh.

(Kiss again)

ELAINE: Is that with the parts and labor?

DAVID: Uh-huh.

ELAINE: Hmm.

(Kiss...again)

ELAINE: Oh, no. No, David. No, please. Not the knuckle....


[Back to George and Nancy in bed. George is looking quite pleased with himself. Nancy, on the other hand, looks...bewildered...pleasantly surprised...]

NANCY: Wow. That was...*great*. I mean...*wow*.

GEORGE: It just came to me.

NANCY: I---I've never in my life have---have I---. What was that?

GEORGE: You mean in the end?

NANCY: Uh-huh.

GEORGE: A counter-clockwise swirl.

(Spotting something on George's hand)

NANCY: What's that?

GEORGE: What?

NANCY: On---on your hand? Let me see what's on your hand.

GEORGE: Nothing. I don't know...just a little dirt.

NANCY: Give me that. (grabs his hand) I wanna see what's on your hand.

(They struggle for a bit, but Nancy finally gets a hold of his hand and tries to make out the scribble)

NANCY: Number one. Take her leg.... Oh, my god! Crib notes? You've got crib notes?!!

GEORGE: It's a very complicated move! I couldn't remember it all.

NANCY: Oh, my god, you're sick. (gets out of bed)

GEORGE: You know, it's not the S.A.T.s!


[Cut to Frank on the streets. He spots Kramer's car. He looks inside the back window and sees the "Bro"---or is it the "Manssierre"? He checks out the plates]

FRANK: Assman? I'll get him, Assman!

(Back to Jerry's apartment)

JERRY: Sixteen hundred dollars? That's all? *Ooh*, they are ripping me off.

ELAINE: So what are you going to do?

JERRY: Well, that's it. I'm going back to Putty. No move is worth this.

ELAINE: Oh! You mean you don't care if he does the move anymore?

JERRY: Are you kidding? He can do every move I've ever done! Do you know what a good mechanic is worth? You can't compare that to sex.

(There's a knock at the door and Jerry goes over to answer it)

JERRY: Hi, Mr. Constanza. What's uh...?

FRANK: Where's your friend Kramer?

JERRY: I don't know. Why?

FRANK: Because I'm looking for him. That's why. He stopped short.

JERRY: What do you mean?

FRANK: In a car, with my wife. He stopped short. You think I don't know what that's about? That's my old move! I used it on Estelle forty years ago! I told everybody about it! Everybody knows! (Demonstrates) Hmmph! I stopped short.

JERRY: Really, stopping short. That's a good move.

FRANK: You're not kidding it's a good move!

(Kramer walks in.)

KRAMER: Hey.

JERRY: Hey.

KRAMER: Hey, Frank.

FRANK: Don't Frank me! I know what you did. How dare you stop short with my wife!

KRAMER: C'mon, Frank, relax. I don't even know what you're talking about.

(Frank backs Kramer into the table, knocking the Fusilli Jerry to the floor)

FRANK: You think I don't know, Assman?!! To think I almost split the profits on the Manssierre with you.

KRAMER: Bro.

FRANK: Manssierre!

KRAMER: Bro!

FRANK: Manssierre! You...!

(Frank grabs Kramer by the collar and in doing so, he slips and falls right on top of the Fusilli Jerry)

FRANK: Aah!!!

JERRY: Oh, my god!

(Everyone gasps in horror, including George, who was just walking in at that very moment)


[At the medical center, the gang is in the waiting room, waiting for the word on Frank's condition. Looks like they're still in shock

JERRY: If I wasn't there, I wouldn't have believed it.

ELAINE: Me either.

GEORGE: They say this guy's the best.

JERRY: He had to use cork-screw pasta.

(At that thought, Jerry, George, and Elaine shift uncomfortably in their seats. Meanwhile, Kramer is checking out the pictures on the wall. He spots something...)

KRAMER: Jerry. Jerry, come here. Take a look at this.

(Jerry joins him)

KRAMER: The name on the boat. Look at it.

JERRY: Assman!

KRAMER: Yeah (points towards the doctor's office), he's the Assman! Jerry, *he's* the Assman!

(The doctor walks in)

DOCTOR: Which one is the son?

GEORGE: (stands up) I am.

DOCTOR: Ah. I'm Doctor Cooperman. I just want you to know that this won't take long. And he's going to be fine.

(Kramer stops Dr. Cooperman at the door.)

KRAMER: Yeah, excuse me, uh... You didn't by any chance recently get the wrong license plates?

DR. COOPERMAN: Yes. I'm still waiting for the motor vehicle bureau to straighten it out.

KRAMER: So...you're the Assman.

(Dr. Cooperman winks and heads back to where Frank is waiting)

FRANK: It was a million to one shot, Doc. Million to one.


[Back at the Costanza's house, George and Frank are just walking in]

ESTELLE: Where have you been?!! You were supposed to fix the stove! I've been waiting for hours!

FRANK: I fell on some Fusilli.

ESTELLE: Fusilli?

FRANK: You know, the corkscrew pasta. It was a Fusilli Jerry. It got stuck in me. Had to go to the proctologist.

ESTELLE: The proctologist? Are you okay?

FRANK: Yeah.

ESTELLE: Oh, I was so worried. (grabs a couple of tissues from the box)

GEORGE: Ma, don't cry!

ESTELLE: Oh, I can't help it!

GEORGE: Ma, your eyes!

ESTELLE: Oh!


The End
