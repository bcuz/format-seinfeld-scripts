[Opening monologue]

What's with the age gap hiring policy at most movie theaters? Didja ever notice, they never hire anyone between the ages of fifteen... and eighty, you know what I mean? Like, the girl that sells you the ticket, she's ten. Then there's the guy who rips the ticket, he's a hundred and two. So, what happened in the middle, there? You couldn't find anybody? It's like they want to show you how life comes full circle. You're fifteen, you sell the tickets. Then you leave, you go out, you have a family, kids, marriage, career, grandchildren, eighty years later, you're back in the same theater three feet away. Ripping tickets. Took you eighty years to move three feet.

% A night at the Improv. Jerry receives some disturbing news from the manager: The show has been delayed.

JERRY: You don't understand. I got this all timed out. I got another spot across town at 9:50, I'm not gonna be able to make it!

% As impeccable and precise in his business dealings as he is with his apartment.

KERNIS: I hear you, guy.

JERRY: And I'm doin' Letterman Monday. You know, I gotta work out the material!

% In the background is the plot complication of the week: Buckles. The manager assures Jerry that Buckles isn't on the menu. He just hangs around hoping that somebody drops out.

KERNIS: Why don't you come back and do the 11 o'clock spot?

JERRY: No, I'm supposed to meet my friends to see this movie ``CheckMate'' at 10:30.

% On consideration, Jerry decides to take the 11 o'clock spot and skip the movie. Jerry is on his way out the door when Buckles spots him.

BUCKLES: Hey, Jer!

JERRY: [not losing a step] Heeeeyyyyyyyy..... [and out the door]
