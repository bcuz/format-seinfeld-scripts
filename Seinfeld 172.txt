						==================================================================<br>
							<br>
							
						[Elaine is getting ready to drive Puddy's car, he's giving her last minute instructions.]<br>
							<br>
							
						PUDDY: Alright, be careful with the car, babe.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Yeah, yeah.<br>
							<br>
							
						PUDDY: And don't move the seat, I got it right where I like it.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Goodbye?<br>
							<br>
							
						PUDDY: Two and ten, babe.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Okay.<br>
							<br>
							
						PUDDY: Don't peel out.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I won't.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Elaine peels out and turns on the car stereo. She hears: &quot;Jesus is one, Jesus is all, Jesus picks me up when I fall...&quot; Elaine changes the stations but all of the presets are set to religious radio stations; &quot;And he said unto Abraham...&quot;, &quot;Amen! Amen!&quot;, &quot;So we pray...&quot;, &quot;Saved!&quot;, &quot;Jey-sus!&quot; She turns off the radio.)<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Jesus?<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Meeting at George's office. His Boss, Mr. Kruger, is speaking.]<br>
							<br>
							
						KRUGER: According to our latest quarterly thing,Kruger Industrial Smoothing is heading into the red. Or the black, or whatever the bad one is. Any thoughts?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Well, I know when I'm a little strapped, I sometimes drop off my rent check having forgotten to sign it. That could buy us some time.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRUGER: Works for me. Good thinking, George.<br>
							<br>
							
						CO-WORKER #1: Alright, George.<br>
							<br>
							
						CO-WORKER #2: Way to go man.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Or we don't even send the check and then when they call, we pretend we're the cleaning service. Heh heh. &quot;Hello? I sorry, no here Kruger.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						KRUGER: Are you done? Silly voices, c'mon people, let's get real.<br>
							<br>
							
						CO-WORKER #1: Good one.<br>
							<br>
							
						CO-WORKER #2: That was bad.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[George and Jerry are at the coffee shop.]<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I had 'em, Jerry. They loved me.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: And then?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I lost them. I can usually come up with one good comment during a meeting but by the end it's buried under a pile of gaffs and bad puns.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Showmanship, George. When you hit that high note, you say goodnight and walk off.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I can't just leave.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: That's the way they do it in Vegas.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: You never played Vegas.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I hear things.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Elaine enters and has a seat.)<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Here's one. I borrowed Puddy's car and all the presets on his radio were Christian rock stations.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I like Christian rock. It's very positive. It's not like those real musicians who think they're so cool and hip.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: So, you think that Puddy actually believes in something?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: It's a used car, he probably never changed the presets.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Yes, he is lazy.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Plus he probably doesn't even know how to program the buttons.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Yes, he is dumb.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: So you prefer dumb and lazy to religious?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Dumb and lazy, I understand.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Tell you how you could check.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: How?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Reprogram all the buttons, see if he changes them back. You know? The old switcheroo.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: No, no, the old switcheroo is you poison your drink then you switch it with the other person's.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: No, it's doing the same thing to someone that they did to you.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yeah, Elaine's gonna do the same thing to Puddy's radio that the radio did to her.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Well that's the gist of it!<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Quiet! So where is this Sophie?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Oh, she's picking me up in a few minutes.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: How long have you two been together?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I dunno. Since the last one. Oh, here she is. You wanna meet her?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE &amp; GEORGE: Nah.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Jerry leaves to go meet Sophie by the register.)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: By the way, how did Puddy get back in the picture?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I needed to move a bureau.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Kramer and Mickey enter Jerry's apartment.]<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Hey Jerry, you got any pepper?<br>
							<br>
							
						MICKEY: Hey Jerry.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hey Mickey. Check the pepper shaker.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Yeah. (inhales some pepper then sneezes violently) See? It should sound like that, something like that.<br>
							<br>
							
						MICKEY: Aah-choo.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: A little wetter. See, I didn't believe it.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What's with the fake sneezing?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Yeah, we're going down to Mt. Sinai Hospital, See they hire actors to help the students practice diagnosing.<br>
							<br>
							
						MICKEY: They assign you a specific disease and you act out the symptoms. It's an easy gig.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Do medical schools actually do this?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Well the better ones. Alright, let's practice retching.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER &amp; MICKEY: HUAAHHH!!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I think the phone is ringing.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER &amp; MICKEY: HUAAHHH!!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Would you hold it a second?! Thank you, will you get out of here with that stuff?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Mickey, DTs.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer and Mickey exit, shaking, while Jerry answers the phone.)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hello?<br>
							<br>
							
						SOPHIE: Hey. It's me.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Elaine?<br>
							<br>
							
						SOPHIE: No, it's me.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: George??<br>
							<br>
							
						SOPHIE: Jerry, it's Sophie. I can't believe you don't recognize my voice.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Oh, I knew it was you, I was joking. I'm a comedian.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer enters.)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: You got any Ipecac?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Ipecac? Kramer, I really think you guys are going too far with this.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: No, Mickey, he swallowed twelve aspirin.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Did he overdose?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: No, it's just too much.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Office meeting at Kruger Industrial Smoothing.]<br>
							<br>
							
						KRUGER: ...And it gets worse. The team working on the statue in Lafayette Square kind of over-smoothed it. They ground the head down to about the size of a softball, and that spells trouble.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Alright, well why don't we smooth the head down to nothing, stick a pumpkin under its arm and change the nameplate to Ichabod Crane?<br>
							<br>
							
						(Everyone at the meeting breaks out in laughter.)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (getting up and leaving) Alright! That's it for me. Goodnight everybody.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Mt. Sanai Hospital, a woman in a lab coat is handing out envelopes to a group of people, Mickey and Kramer included.]<br>
							<br>
							
						DR. WEXLER: In your packet you will find the disease you have been assigned and the symptoms you will need to exhibit.<br>
							<br>
							
						MICKEY: Bacterial Meningitis. Jackpot!<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Gonorrhea? You wanna trade?<br>
							<br>
							
						MICKEY: Sorry buddy, this is the &quot;Hamlet&quot; of diseases. Severe pain, nausea, delusions, it's got everything.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER (to the man beside him) Howbout you, do you wanna trade?<br>
							<br>
							
						MAN: Sure.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Okay, what do you got?<br>
							<br>
							
						MAN: The surgeon left a sponge inside me.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Good luck with that.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[George and Jerry are at Jerry's apartment.]<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I knew I had hit my high note so I thanked the crowd and I was gone.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What did you do the rest of the day?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I saw &quot;Titanic&quot;. So that old woman, she's just a liar, right?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: And a bit of a tramp if you ask me.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Elaine enters.)<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Hello boys.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Hey, so, did you give that radio the old switcheroo?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I did.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: And the Christian rock?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Ressurected! And look what I pried off of his bumper, a Jesus fish!<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Jerry, do you have any fishsticks?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: No. So you're disappointed he's a spiritual person?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Well yeah, I got him because he seemed so one-dimensional, I feel misled.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I think it's neat. You don't hear that much about god anymore.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I hear things. Hey, so Sophie gave me the &quot;It's me&quot; on the phone today.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: &quot;It's me?&quot; Isn't it a little premature?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I thought so.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Hah. She's not a &quot;me&quot;. I'm a &quot;me&quot;.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I'm against all &quot;it's me&quot;s. So self-absorbed and egotistical, it's like those hip musicians with their complicated shoes!<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer enters.)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Well, I got gonorrhea.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: That seems about right.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: That's what they gave me.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: They? The Government?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: No, no. He's pretending he's got gonorrhea so med students can diagnose it.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: And it's a waste of my talent. It's just a little burning. Mickey, he got bacterial meningitis.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I guess there are no small diseases, only small actors.<br>
							<br>
							
						(The other three start laughing.)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (leaving) Alright that's it for me. Good night everybody.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: What was that?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Showmanship, George is trying to get out on a high note.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: See, showmanship. Maybe that's what my gonorrhea is missing.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yes! Step into that spotlight and belt that gonorrhea out to the back row.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Yes, yes I will! I'm gonna make people feel my gonorrhea, and feel the gonorrhea themselves.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Mt. Sanai Hospital. Kramer is on the table surrounded by med students.]<br>
							<br>
							
						STUDENT #1: And are you experiencing any discomfort?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Just a little burning during urination.<br>
							<br>
							
						STUDENT #1: Okay, any other pain?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: The haunting memories of lost love. May I? (signals to Mickey) Lights? (Mickey turns down the lights and Kramer lights a cigar) Our eyes met across the crowded hat store. I, a customer, and she a coquettish haberdasher. Oh, I pursued and she withdrew, then she pursued and I withdrew, and so we danced. I burned for her, much like the burning during urination that I would experience soon afterwards.<br>
							<br>
							
						STUDENT #1: Gonorrhea?!<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Gonorrhea!<br>
							<br>
							
						(The lab breaks out in spontaneous applause as Mickey turns up the lights and Kramer takes a bow.)<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Jerry and George are back at Jerry's apartment. Jerry is checking his phone messages.]<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: One message. Hope it's not from you.<br>
							<br>
							
						ANSWERING MACHINE: &quot;Hey Jerry, it's me. Call me back.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Sophie.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: She's still doing that?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yep.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Alright, I'll tell you what you do. You call her back and give her the &quot;it's me&quot;, heh? Pull the old switcheroo.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I think that's a &quot;what's good for the goose is good for the gander&quot;.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: What the hell is a gander, anyway?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (picking up the phone and dialing) It's a goose that's had the old switcheroo pulled on it. Hi Sophie, it's me.<br>
							<br>
							
						SOPHIE: Hey Raef.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (to George) She thinks it's someone named Raef.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Good, let her think it.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (into the phone, with a disguised voice) So, what's going on?<br>
							<br>
							
						SOPHIE: Not a lot.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Ask about you, ask about you.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: So, uh, how are things with Jerry?<br>
							<br>
							
						SOPHIE: Oh, I really like him but, well, I still haven't told him the tractor story.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Right, right, the tractor story.<br>
							<br>
							
						SOPHIE: Are you sick, Raef? You sound kinda funny.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I sound funny?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Abort! Abort!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yeah I better get to a doctor, bye. (Hangs up) That was close! What drives me to take chances like that?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: That was very real.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: She said there's some tractor story that she hasn't told me about.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Woah, back it up, back it up. Beep, beep, beep. Tractor story?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Beep, beep, beep? What are you doing?<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Elaine and Puddy are at Puddy's apartment.]<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: So where do you wanna eat?<br>
							<br>
							
						PUDDY: Feels like an Arby's night.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Arby's. Beef and cheese and do you believe in god?<br>
							<br>
							
						PUDDY: Yes.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oh. So, you're pretty religious?<br>
							<br>
							
						PUDDY: That's right.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: So is it a problem that I'm not really religious?<br>
							<br>
							
						PUDDY: Not for me.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Why not?<br>
							<br>
							
						PUDDY: I'm not the one going to hell.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Jerry and George are at the coffee shop.]<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: You know what I think? I bet she stole a tractor.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: No one's stealing a tractor, it's a five-mile-an-hour getaway. We're dancing around the obvious, it's gotta be disfigurement.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Does she walk around holding a pen she never seems to need?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: No, she looks completely normal.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Oh. Okay, here it is, I got it. She lost her thumbs in a tractor accident and they grafted her big toes on. They do it every day.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You think she's got toes for thumbs?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: How's her handshake? A little firm, isn't it? Maybe a little too firm?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I don't know.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Hands a little smelly?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Why do I seek your counsel?<br>
							<br>
							
						(Elaine walks in.)<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Well I'm going to hell.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: That seems about right.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: According to Puddy.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hey, have you heard the one about the guy in hell with the coffee and the doughtnuts and--<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I'm not in the mood.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (To a passing waitress) I'll have some coffee and a doughnut.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What do you care? You don't believe in hell.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I know, but he does.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: So it's more of a relationship problem than the final destination of your soul.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Well, relationships are very important to me.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Maybe you can strike one up with the prince of darkness as you burn for all eternity.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (to the waitress bringing his doughnut) And a slice of devil's food cake.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Kruger's office. George enters, seeing nobody but Mr. Kruger.]<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Hey. Where is everyone?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRUGER: They're all off the project. They were boring. George, you are my main man.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I am?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRUGER: I don't know what it is, I can't put my finger on it, but lately you have just seemed 'on'. And you always leave me wanting more.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: This is a huge project involving lots of numbers and papers and folders.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRUGER: Ah, I'm not too worried about it. Let's get started.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Okay.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRUGER: George? Check it out. (He begins to spin around in his chair) Three times around, no feet.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: And?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRUGER: All me.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Kramer and Mickey are back at Mt. Sinai.]<br>
							<br>
							
						DR. WEXLER: Alright, and here are you ailments for this week. By the way, Mr. Kramer, you were excellent.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Oh, thank you.<br>
							<br>
							
						MICKEY: Cirrhosis of the liver with jaundice! Alright I get to wear make-up! What did you get?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Gonorrhea? Excuse me, I think there's been a mistake, see, I had gonorrhea last week.<br>
							<br>
							
						DR. WEXLER: Oh, it's no mistake. We loved what you did with it.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: I don't believe this, I'm being typecast.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Jerry and Sophie are at Jerry's playing chess.]<br>
							<br>
							
						SOPHIE: I move my knight... here. Check.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: They should update these pieces, nobody rides horses anymore. Maybe they should change it to a tractor.<br>
							<br>
							
						SOPHIE: Jerry, are you embarrassed that you're losing?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Losing? You know, yesterday I lost control of my car, almost bought the farm.<br>
							<br>
							
						SOPHIE: Bought the farm?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Tractor!<br>
							<br>
							
						SOPHIE: This is an odd side of you, Jerry. I feel uncomfortable.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Wait, don't go. Let's thumb wrestle.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Sophie drops her purse and when she bends down to pick it up, Jerry nods knowingly.)<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Jerry and George are at the coffee shop.]<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: A scar?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: A big long scar where her leg would dangle when she's riding a...?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: A tractor.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I'm sure she's a little self-conscious and doesn't like to talk about it.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I don't see why's she more self-conscious about that than her toe thumbs.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: She doesn't have toe thumbs.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Well, if she keeps horsing around with that tractor--<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Alright. So how's the two-man operation at Kruger?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Two-man? It's all me. Kruger doesn't do anything; Disappears for hours at a time, gives me fake excuses. This afternoon I found him with sleep creases on his face. The only reason I got out to get a bite today was that he finally promised to buckle down and do some actual work. (turning around, George sees Mr. Kruger at a booth eating a piece of cake) Oh, I don't believe this. This is what I have to put up with, Jerry. (He walks over) Mr. Kruger? Who said he was going to do some actual work today? Who?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRUGER: I'm not too worried about it.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Well I am. Couldn't you try to go through some of that stuff I put in your shoebox?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRUGER: Alright, alright I'm going.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (to Jerry) Huh-ho! Have you ever seen anything like this?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Never.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Elaine's hallway. The door opens, Puddy steps out in his bathrobe. There's a newspaper in front of the door across from Elaine's.]<br>
							<br>
							
						PUDDY: Elaine, they forgot to deliver your paper today. Why don't you just grab that one.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: 'Cause that belongs to Mr. Potato Guy, that's his.<br>
							<br>
							
						PUDDY: C'mon, get it.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Well if you want it, you get it.<br>
							<br>
							
						PUDDY: Sorry, thou shalt not steal.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oh, but it's ok for me?<br>
							<br>
							
						PUDDY: What do you care, you know where you're going.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Alright, that is it! I can't live like this.<br>
							<br>
							
						PUDDY: Nah.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: C'mon.<br>
							<br>
							
						PUDDY: Alright, what did I do?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: David, I'm going to hell! The worst place in the world! With devils and those caves and the ragged clothing! And the heat! My god, the heat! I mean, what do you think about all that?<br>
							<br>
							
						PUDDY: Gonna be rough.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Uh, you should be trying to save me!<br>
							<br>
							
						PUDDY: Don't boss me! This is why you're going to hell.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I am not going to hell and if you think I'm going to hell, you should care that I'm going to hell even though I am not.<br>
							<br>
							
						PUDDY: You stole my Jesus fish, didn't you?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Yeah, that's right!<br>
							<br>
							
						(Elaine places her hands beside her head, index fingers raised as 'horns' and she emits a gutteral growling sound.)<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Mt Sanai Hospital. The actors are gathered. Mickey is practicing his part.]<br>
							<br>
							
						MICKEY: Oh, my liver! Why did I drink all those years? Why did I look for love in a bottle?<br>
							<br>
							
						DR. WEXLER: Mr. Kramer? You're up.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer walks in, his face is noticably yellow.)<br>
							<br>
							
						MICKEY: Wait a minute. You are doing gonorrhea, aren't you?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Well, we'll see.<br>
							<br>
							
						STUDENT #2: So, what seems to be bothering you today, Mr. Kramer?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: (pulling a liquor bottle from his jacket pocket) Well, I guess it started about twenty years ago when I got back from Viet Nam, and this was the only friend I had left.<br>
							<br>
							
						MICKEY: Hey! That's my cirrhosis! He's stealing my cirrhosis! (he jumps Kramer) You wanna be sick? I'll make you sick.<br>
							<br>
							
						(They fall to the floor, wrestling.)<br>
							<br>
							
						STUDENT #2: Cirrhosis of the liver and PCP addiction?<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Elaine and Puddy have gone to see a priest, Father Curtis.]<br>
							<br>
							
						FATHER CURTIS: Let me see if I understand this. You're concerned that he isn't concerned that you're going to hell. And you feel that she's too bossy.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE &amp; PUDDY: Yeah, that's right.<br>
							<br>
							
						FATHER CURTIS: Well, oftentimes in cases of inter-faith marriages, couples have difficulty--<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE (Interrupting) Woah, woah, woah! No one's getting married here.<br>
							<br>
							
						FATHER CURTIS: You aren't?<br>
							<br>
							
						PUDDY: No.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: We're just, you know, having a good time.<br>
							<br>
							
						FATHER CURTIS: Oh, well then it's simple. You're both going to hell.<br>
							<br>
							
						PUDDY: No way, this is bogus, man!<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Well, thank you father.<br>
							<br>
							
						FATHER CURTIS: Oh, did you hear the one about the new guy in hell who's talkng to the devil by the coffee machine?<br>
							<br>
							
						PUDDY: I'm really not in the mood, I'm going to hell.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oh, lighten up. It'll only feel like an eternity.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Elaine makes the same 'fingers up' devil gesture as she did in her apartment and Father Curtis joins in.)<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Jerry and Sophie ar at Jerry's apartment.]<br>
							<br>
							
						SOPHIE: You know, Jerry, there's this thing that I haven't told you about. See, there was this tractor and, oh boy, this is really difficult.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Sophie, it's me. I know about the tractor story and I'm fine with it.<br>
							<br>
							
						SOPHIE: How could you know?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (putting his finger to Sophie's lips, then to his own, then back to Sopie's) Shh. Shh. Shh. It's not important. What's important is I'm not gonna let a little thing like that ruin what could be a very long-term and meaningful relationship.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer and Mickey barge in, they're in the middle of an argument.)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: ...I didn't say that, no.<br>
							<br>
							
						MICKEY: You gave me gonorrhea, you didn't even tell me!<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Well, I'm sorry. I gave you gonorrhea because I thought you'd have fun with it.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hey, hey! I'm with someone.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Oh. Hello.<br>
							<br>
							
						SOPHIE: No, I understand. This could be a tough thing to deal with. The important thing is that you have a partner who's supportive.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: (to Mickey) You know? She's right.<br>
							<br>
							
						SOPHIE: Unfortunately, I didn't have a partner. I got gonorrhea from a tractor.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You got gonorrhea from a tractor?? And you call *that* your tractor story??<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: You can't get it from that.<br>
							<br>
							
						SOPHIE: But I did. My boyfriend said I got gonorrhea from riding the tractor in my bathing suit.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (walking out) Alright, that's it for me. You've been great. Goodnight everybody.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Mr. Kruger and George are burning the midnight oil. George is working, Mr. Kruger is bouncing a ball against the wall and catching it. George is percolating.]<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Would you mind helping me out with some of this stuff?!?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRUGER: You seem like you've got a pretty good handle on it.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: No! I don't! Don't you even care? This is your company! It's your name on the outside of the building! Speaking of which, the 'R' fell off and all it says now is K-uger!<br>
							<br>
							
						KRUGER: K-uger, that sounds like one of those old-time car horns, huh? K-uger! K-uger!<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Huh-ho! Oh! You are too much, Mr. Kruger! Too much!<br>
							<br>
							
						KRUGER: (getting up to leave) Thank you George, you've been great. That's it for me.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Oh no, you're not going out on a high note with me Mr. Kruger!<br>
							<br>
							
						KRUGER: It's K-uger!<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: No! No!<br>
							<br>
							
						KRUGER: Goodnight everybody!<br>
							<br>
							<br>
