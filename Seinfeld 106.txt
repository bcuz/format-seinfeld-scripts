							[Opening Monologue] <br>
							<br>
							They call themselves exterminators but they can't really do it. The best they can do is get the bugs to somebody else's house. They just relocate them , y'know what I mean, they're bug realtors is what they are. Ahmmmm.. I'll think you'll be happy here , there's a lotta crumbs not much light, ahmmm they usually sleep through the night, so you'll really have a (?) of the place. Nobody really cares about killing insects, even the animal rights people don't care. You could probably walk into an animal rights organization meeting and hear a speech like; The only way to stop the cruelty of the scientific testing on animals is (slaps his face)...Ha! Got him , is to boycott these companies. <br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							[Restaurant]<br>
							<br>
							GEORGE: Jerry it's funny, Paula and I actually met because of Elaine. <br>
							<br>
							PAULA: Elaine is in my drawing class at the new school <br>
							<br>
							GEORGE: ..And I went down there one time to see... <br>
							<br>
							JERRY: (cuts in) A nude model. <br>
							<br>
							GEORGE: If Elaine wanted to get some coffee. <br>
							<br>
							JERRY: You know I went out once with a nude model. Never let me see her naked. Hundreds of people see her naked every week, except me. Needless to say it was quite vexing. <br>
							<br>
							GEORGE: Are you through? <br>
							<br>
							JERRY: Yeah! <br>
							<br>
							GEORGE: So Anyway, I started to compliment Elaine on her sketches and it turns out,they're Paula's. <br>
							<br>
							PAULA: George, I just like to doodle <br>
							<br>
							(Jerry picks up a pecan that his girlfriend had just masticated.)<br>
							<br>
							GEORGE: Oh! Dropped a napkin...(Whispers) Jerry! <br>
							<br>
							JERRY: What? <br>
							<br>
							GEORGE: What are you doing?...She had those nuts in her mouth, she just spit them out. <br>
							<br>
							JERRY: (spits the nut) OooH!!! You. you ate these? You sucked on these and put them on the plate? <br>
							<br>
							SHELLY: Well I didn't know you were gonna eat them? <br>
							<br>
							JERRY: Soo... <br>
							<br>
							SHELLY: I'm sorry you find me so repulsive? <br>
							<br>
							JERRY: No ,no I don't, I mean, Don't be silly.. <br>
							<br>
							SHELLY: Yeah! <br>
							<br>
							JERRY: It's just... <br>
							<br>
							SHELLY: Well, hem ,if you'll excuse me I think I'll just go to the ladies room. <br>
							<br>
							PAULA: I'll join you. <br>
							<br>
							JERRY: Oh! man did you see that. I ate discarded food. <br>
							<br>
							GEORGE: Well I've done that. <br>
							<br>
							JERRY: Yeah, but with you it's intentional. <br>
							<br>
							GEORGE: Haven't you kissed her? <br>
							<br>
							JERRY: Yeah, but this is different , this is like ,you know, semi digested food stuff. You know the next stop is the stomach and you can take it from there. <br>
							<br>
							(George stops a passing busboy) <br>
							<br>
							GEORGE: Excuse me just for a second. ( fixes his hair looking at his reflection in a coffee pot.) <br>
							<br>
							JERRY: AH. Yes that's gonna make a big difference. <br>
							<br>
							GEORGE: This is dating , you can't leave anything to chance. <br>
							<br>
							JERRY: Hey ,You think that Shelly's upset that I made such a big deal about the pecan. <br>
							<br>
							GEORGE: Hehummm , Yeah! <br>
							<br>
							JERRY: Thanks. <br>
							<br>
							GEORGE: No problem. <br>
							<br>
							(The girls return from the ladies room.) <br>
							<br>
							SHELLY: Well Jerry , I guess we should get going . <br>
							<br>
							JERRY: Ah! boy. <br>
							<br>
							GEORGE: Well, it was very nice meeting you Shelly and Jerry be careful, there's a lot of nuts out there. (to Paula) All right you have everything? <br>
							<br>
							PAULA: Can you grab my purse. <br>
							<br>
							GEORGE: Yeah.( reaches for the purse and finds a piece of paper . he looks annoyed. <br>
							<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							<br>
							[Monks, next day. George showing Jerry the piece of paper he picked up] <br>
							<br>
							JERRY: Yeah! So <br>
							<br>
							GEORGE: Don't you see what this is? <br>
							<br>
							JERRY: Yeah! It's a doodle. <br>
							<br>
							GEORGE: Yeah!, a doodle of me...look at the size of the nose , the ears, all my features are distorted. <br>
							<br>
							JERRY: Oh!.It's an affectionate caricature. <br>
							<br>
							GEORGE: I'm grotesque . I look like a troll. <br>
							<br>
							JERRY: It's just a drawing. <br>
							<br>
							GEORGE: Don't you see what this says? How can you possibly like somebody ,if you think they look like this? <br>
							<br>
							(Elaine walks in) <br>
							<br>
							GEORGE: (gets up to leave the table) HELLO!!! (angrily) <br>
							<br>
							ELAINE: What is with him? <br>

							<br>
							JERRY: Oh! Come on, you told them you're from out-of-town just so you could stay in a hotel room. <br>
							<br>
							ELAINE: I know, I know Jerry.. but it's The Plazaaa... I've never stayed there .It'll be like a little vacation <br>
							<br>
							JERRY: Well be sure to catch a Broadway show while you're in town. <br>

							JERRY: I dunno , I'm gonna ask Shelley ,but she still might be upset from the masticated pecan incident. <br>
							<br>
							ELAINE: Hey!! I found out from Paula; She likes George. I'll bet he'll be relieved. <br>
							<br>
							JERRY: Yeah.. When he's dead he'll be relieved... Oh by the way Viking Press sent a Fedex for you to my parents. They brought it with 'em. <br>
							<br>
							ELAINE: Yeah that's just some stuff about the company. <br>
							<br>
							GEORGE: Hum..( to Elaine) Hey! did you talk to Paula? <br>

							ELAINE: Well..hum...let me rephrase that, She said.... <br>
							<br>
							GEORGE: She thinks I'm ugly. I knew it. <br>
							<br>
							JERRY: You see the thing of it is, there's a lot of ugly people out there walking around, but they don't know they're ugly, because nobody actually tells them. <br>
							<br>
							GEORGE: .....So what's your point? <br>
							<br>
							JERRY: I dunno... <br>
							<br>
							ELAINE: Okay.. The point , George, is she likes you. <br>
							<br>
							GEORGE: Oh!, so what. I'd rather she hate me and thought I was good looking....At least I can get somebody else. (scratching his chest) What is this? Why am I itching? <br>

							<br>
							JERRY: Oh! but I do. There's probably fleas crawling all over your little snack bar. ( as he says this Newman is wildly scratching behind his back. he suddenly stops when Jerry turns around) <br>
							<br>
							NEWMAN: So , you have fleas. Maybe you keep your house in a state of disrepair. Maybe you live in squalor.<br>
							<br>
							JERRY: You know Newman , the thing about fleas is that they irritate the skin and they start to...itch. Oh! maybe you can hold out five seconds or ten, maybe fifteen or twenty but after a while, no matter how much will power a person may have. It won't matter, because they're crawling , crawling on your skin. Up your legs , up your spine , up your back..... <br>
							<br>
							NEWMAN: (Cannot take this torture anymore) Baaaaaaaaarrhhhhhhhhhhh....I'm ripped with fleas ( scratches furiously) <br>
