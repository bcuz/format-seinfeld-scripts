						[Opening Monologue]<br>
							<br>
							
						The thing I don&#146;t understand about the suicide person is the people who try and commit suicide for some reason they don&#146;t die and that&#146;s it. They stop trying. Why? Why don&#146;t they just keep trying? What has changed? Is their life any better now? No. In fact it&#146;s worse because now they&#146;ve found out one more thing you stink at. Okay, that&#146;s why these people don&#146;t succeed in life to begin with. Because they give up too easy. I saw, pills don&#146;t work, try a rope. Car won&#146;t start in the garage, get a tune up. You know what I mean? There&#146;s nothing more rewarding than reaching a goal you have set for yourself.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Jerry&#146;s Apartment]<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Let me ask you a question. If you named a kid Rasputin do you think that would have a negative effect on his life?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Na.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What are you doing? We&#146;re going out for dinner in ten minutes.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Do you realize this is the last meal I am going to have for three days?<br>
							<br>
							
						(buzzer)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yeah.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: It&#146;s George.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Come on up. . . . I never heard of this. You&#146;ve got to fast for three days to take an ulcer test. How you gonna do that?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I don&#146;t know. How could I possibly have ulcers? Who could have given me ulcers?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I think I&#146;ll take out the garbage.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Hey, have you ever fasted?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Well, once I didn&#146;t have dinner until, like 9:00 o&#146;clock, that was pretty rough. (exits to hall with garbage &#150; meets George) Hey, do me a favour will ya&#146;? Throw out my garbage for me.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Yeah, right.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Come on, it&#146;s just down the hall.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Give me two bucks. I&#146;ll do it for two bucks.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I&#146;ll give you 50 cents.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: There&#146;s no way I touch that bag for less than two dollars.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Come on. Fifty cents. (??) a piece of Drake&#146;s coffee cake<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: You&#146;re not getting no Drake&#146;s Coffee Cake for fifty cents. Yae, Hey, I&#146;m all set. I got the ticket. I&#146;m going to the Cayman Islands this Friday.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I don&#146;t get you. Who goes on vacation without a job? What do you need a break from getting up at eleven?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: It&#146;s an incredible deal. I don&#146;t know why you don&#146;t come with me.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Nah, I don&#146;t go for these non-refundable deals. I can&#146;t commit to a woman. I&#146;m not going to commit to an airline.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Gina enters the hall)<br>
							<br>
							
						GINA: Hi.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hi.<br>
							<br>
							
						GINA: How are you?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Gina, do you know what a Drake&#146;s Coffee Cake is?<br>
							<br>
							
						GINA: Of course, the plane cake with the sweet brown crumbs on the top.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: How much do they cost?<br>
							<br>
							
						GINA: The junior?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: No, no the full size.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: No, no the junior.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: You didn&#146;t say &quot;junior&quot;.<br>
							<br>
							
						GINA: I haven&#146;t had one of those since I was a little girl.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Really? You should be ashamed of yourself. I want you out of here! (MARTIN enters the hall) How ya&#146; doing?<br>
							<br>
							
						MARTIN: Good enough.<br>
							<br>
							
						(MARTIN leaves with Gina)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Boy she&#146;s sexy isn&#146;t she?<br>
							<br>
							
						(Jerry leaves garbage bag by Kramer&#146;s apartment and knocks on the door. As he and George enter Jerry&#146;s apartment Kramer comes out and takes the garbage bag.)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Do you believe that guy?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: What guy?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: My neighbour:<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oh, that creepy guy?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yeah, did he think I was flirting with her?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: He didn&#146;t seem too pleased.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Maybe I&#146;ll get a steak with french fried onion wings.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: hey, you know what? I just remembered something. I had a dream about that guy last night. This is amazing.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What&#146;s so amazing? You&#146;ve seen him before.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I haven&#146;t seen him for months.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What was the dream?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I was doing standup comedy in Kennebunkport Maine. ??? night club. The stage was on a cliff and the audience was throwing all the comics off.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I think I&#146;ve played there.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I&#146;ve had a lot of other paranormal stuff happen to me.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You&#146;re a little paranormal<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Hey, George, you know my friend goes to a psychic.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Really?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Uh uh, you should go some time.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I&#146;d love to go. Make an appointment.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Psychics, vacations. How about getting a job?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I just got fired.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Alright, come on, lets get out of here.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I wonder what Ghandi ate before his fast.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I heard he used to polish off a box of Triscuits.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Really?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Oh, yeah. Ghandi loved Triscuits.<br>
							<br>
							
						(They exit)<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Jerry&#146;s apartment late at night there is knocking at the door]<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Who is it? Who is it?<br>
							<br>
							
						GINA: It&#146;s Gina.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Who?<br>
							<br>
							
						GINA: Martine&#146;s girl friend.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Martine?<br>
							<br>
							
						GINA: You next door neighbour.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Oh, Martin!<br>
							<br>
							
						(Jerry opens door)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: It&#146;s Martine. I think he&#146;s dying. He tried to kill himself with pills.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What?<br>
							<br>
							
						GINA: Come on.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: In my pajamas? I better get my robe.<br>
							<br>
							
						GINA: We don&#146;t have enough time.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: It&#146;ll take two seconds.<br>
							<br>
							
						GINA: There is no time.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: We don&#146;t have two seconds?<br>
							<br>
							
						GINA: All right. Go ahead.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Nah, forget it.<br>
							<br>
							
						GINA: No, go ahead.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Nah. I&#146;ll just wear the pajamas.<br>
							<br>
							
						GINA: Will you just get it.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Are you sure?<br>
							<br>
							
						GINA: Forget it. Come on.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Nah, I&#146;ll go get the robe.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Metropolitan Hospital Center]<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: That&#146;s not too bad. It&#146;s not like a Sunny von Bulow comma. The doctor said he should snap out of it anytime.<br>
							<br>
							
						GINA: You know why he did this? Because I told him it was over. I did not want to see him anymore.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Really? It&#146;s over?<br>
							<br>
							
						GINA: I could not stand it another minute. Yesterday he turned over a man&#146;s hot dog stand because he thought the man was looking at me. And then after he saw you in the hall. Ach, he was crazy with jealousy.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Oh boy, did he say anything about me?<br>
							<br>
							
						GINA: He does not like you. And all indications are he does not like Drake&#146;s Coffee Cake.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: He said that?<br>
							<br>
							
						GINA: He was screaming about it all night. How it&#146;s too sweet and it falls apart when you eat it.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I&#146;m sorry if I caused any trouble. I was just being friendly.<br>
							<br>
							
						GINA: I wasn&#146;t.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You weren&#146;t?<br>
							<br>
							
						GINA: No, I have thought about you many times. Have you thought about me?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Of course.<br>
							<br>
							
						GINA: Tell me everything.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Are you sure he can&#146;t hear anything? . . .MARTIN, MARTIN.<br>
							<br>
							
						GINA: I wish he was not in a coma. I wish he was dead. I wish I could pull the plug out from him.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I, would, I would wait on that. I know how you feel but. Juries today, you never know how they&#146;re going to look at a thing like this.<br>
							<br>
							
						GINA: I saw you looking at your watch. You want to leave? Go ahead.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: No, I just wanted to see what time it was.<br>
							<br>
							
						GINA: Are you afraid of him?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: No.<br>
							<br>
							
						GINA: Then kiss me.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Here?<br>
							<br>
							
						GINA: Yes, right here.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Is this the proper venue?<br>
							<br>
							
						GINA: You don&#146;t want to?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: No, no, I want to. I, I very much want to. I, I desire to. I, I pine to.<br>
							<br>
							
						GINA: Then kiss me right in front of him.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I can&#146;t. What if he wakes up?<br>
							<br>
							
						GINA: A man is lying here unconscious and you&#146;re afraid of him? What kind of a man are you?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: A man who respects a good comma. If it was one of those in and out comas, maybe. But when a guy&#146;s got a coma going like this &#133; you don&#146;t want to mess with it.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Jerry&#146;s apartment]<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Hey.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hey.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Did you hear about Martin?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yeah, I heard.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: I can&#146;t believe he&#146;s in a coma.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: He&#146;s got my vacuum cleaner. You know I loaned it to him. He never returned it. The carpets are filthy. What am I going to do?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Who told you about Martin?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Newman! He&#146;s good friends with him.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERR: Oh, big mouth Newman. I should have guessed.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: He&#146;s got all of my attachments, you know.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hey, let me ask you something. How long do you have to wait for a guy to come out of a coma before you can ask his ex-girlfriend out?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: What, Gina? Why wait? Why not just call Doctor Kavorkian?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You know I don&#146;t get that whole suicide machine. There&#146;s no tall buildings where these people live? They can&#146;t wrap their lips around a revolver like a normal person?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: So what&#146;s going on between you and Gina?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Well, I went with her to the hospital last night.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Uh, uh.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: So we&#146;re in the room and she&#146;s trying to get me to kiss her right in front of him.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Uh, uh, you see that&#146;s the great thing about Mediterranean women. All right, so what did you do?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Nothing.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Ah, what kind of a man are you? The guy is unconscious in a coma and you don&#146;t have the guts to kiss his girlfriend?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I didn&#146;t know what the coma etiquette was.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: There is no coma etiquette. You see that&#146;s the beauty of the coma, man. It doesn&#146;t matter what you do around it.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: So you&#146;re saying, his girl, his car, his clothes, it&#146;s all up for grabs. You can just loot the coma victim.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: I&#146;d give him 24 hours to get out of it. They can&#146;t get out of it in 24 hours, it&#146;s a land rush.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: So if the coma victim wakes up in a month, he&#146;s thrilled, he got out of the coma. He goes home, there&#146;s nothing left?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: NOTHING LEFT! That&#146;s why I&#146;m trying to get that vacuum cleaner. Because somebody&#146;s going to grab it.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[The psychic&#146;s apartment]<br>
							<br>
							
						RULA: Martin&#146;s spirit came to you as a warning.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Why would he come to George?<br>
							<br>
							
						RULA: Because George has heightened extra sensory perception. FAYGY GET YOUR FINGER OUT OF YOUR NOSE.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I knew it. I always felt different.<br>
							<br>
							
						RULA: You are. Some coffee cake?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Drakes?<br>
							<br>
							
						RULA: Yes.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Did you buy this for me?<br>
							<br>
							
						RULA: No, why?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Ha, because I love Drake&#146;s Coffee Cake.<br>
							<br>
							
						RULA: Maybe I did.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Take it away.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: She hasn&#146;t eaten in two days.<br>
							<br>
							
						RULA: Who&#146;s Pauline?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Pauline? . . . Wait a minute. I got it. My brother once impregnated a woman named Pauline.<br>
							<br>
							
						RULA: Do you think about her?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: When I hear her name mentioned.<br>
							<br>
							
						RULA: Cut these with your left hand.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: There was a woman, Audrey. She had a very big nose.<br>
							<br>
							
						RULA: I see an Audrey, but with a small nose.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Yes, yes, she had a nose job. I loved her very deeply. Will she ever speak to me again?<br>
							<br>
							
						RULA: Not in this life.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Should you be smoking?<br>
							<br>
							
						RULA: Does it bother you?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: You&#146;re pregnant.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Elaine.<br>
							<br>
							
						RULA: I smoked when I had Faisy.<br>
							<br>
							
						RULA: Ah oh.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Ah oh? What? What Ah oh?<br>
							<br>
							
						RULA: I don&#146;t know about this trip George.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: You can see the Cayman Islands in there? Is something going to happen to me? What?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: It&#146;s really bad for the fetus. Do you know that.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Elaine, she&#146;s a psychic. She knows how the kid&#146;s going to be.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Should I not go on this trip?<br>
							<br>
							
						RULA: George, I am going to tell you something and I want you to really hear me.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Now listen. I just don&#146;t know how a person, with everything we now know about pre-natal care can put a cigarette in her mouth.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Elaine, what are you doing?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: It&#146;s disgusting.<br>
							<br>
							
						RULA: I DON&#146;T BELIVE IT. I would like you both to leave.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oh fine, I don&#146;t like to be around people who are just so irresponsible.<br>
							<br>
							
						RULA: Get the hell out.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Elaine leaving)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: A plane crash? A Heart attack? Lupus? Is it Lupus?<br>
							<br>
							
						RULA: Do you want me to call the super? He was an Israeli commando.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: If you don&#146;t say anything I will assume it&#146;s a plane crash.<br>
							<br>
							
						RULA: Get out.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Not a plane crash. (leaving) Is it a plane crash?<br>

						GINA: I do not like your toothbrush. There are no bristles.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You can say what you want about me but I&#146;ll be damned if I&#146;m going to stand here while you insult my toothbrush.<br>
							<br>
							
						GINA: It is too small for someone with such a big mouth (kisses Kerry). Let me ask you. What will you do if Martine wakes up? Run away like a mouse?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: No, more like the Three Stooges at the end of every movie.<br>
							<br>
							
						GINA: Who are these Stooges you speak of?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: They&#146;re a comedy team.<br>
							<br>
							
						GINA: Tell me about them. Everything.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Well, they&#146;re three kind of funny looking guys and they hit each other a lot.<br>
							<br>
							
						GINA: You will show me The Stooges?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I will show you The Stooges.<br>
							<br>
							
						GINA: When?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Well, I don&#146;t really know where The Stooges are right now but if I locate them you will be the first to know.<br>
							<br>
							
						GINA: Come, you walk me to a cab.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Well, uh, I uh, I don&#146;t want you to get upset or anything but uh, with Martin and all, well maybe it&#146;s not such a good idea for us to be seen together in the building, because, you know, he had a lot of friends here.<br>
							<br>
							
						GINA: You&#146;re still afraid. You are not a man.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Well then what are all those ties and sport jackets doing in my closet?<br>
							<br>
							
						GINA: Are you going to walk me to a cab or not?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yeah, all right. All right.<br>

						(Jerry and Gina meet Kramer and leaving his apartment with Newman)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: You should just eat fruit.<br>
							<br>
							
						NEWMAN: I can&#146;t eat fruit. It makes me incontinent.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: ???<br>
							<br>
							
						NEWMAN: Hello Gina. Hello Jerry.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hello Newman.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Metropolitan Hospital Center - Hallway]<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Do you think Newman would tell Martin if he wakes up? What kind of sicko would do that? He could kill me.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: People smoke, Elaine. My mother smoked. It didn&#146;t hurt me.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: (jumps with fear to Jerry) Did you see that wall move?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Boy, it&#146;s a good thing we came.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Could there be a native p0roblem in the Caymans? Maybe there&#146;s native unrest.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Hi, I haven&#146;t eaten in three days. I was wondering how much longer it would be until I get my X-ray.<br>
							<br>
							
						NURSE: We&#146;ll call you.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: George, I want you to promise me something. If I&#146;m ever in a comma. In the first 24 hours get everything out of my apartment and put it in storage.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: How come?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Looters.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: How do we know that dog food is any good? Who tastes it?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: She&#146;s really hungry.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer enters)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Hey.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Kramer<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Well, Newman&#146;s upstairs visiting Martin.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Would you buy my Cayman Island ticket?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: You&#146;re not going?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: No.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Why not?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: The psychic said something terrible will happen.<br>

						[Metropolitan Hospital Center - Martin&#146;s room]<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: I want my vacuum cleaner! I know you can hear me. Look my mother, she&#146;s going to come and visit me. She sees that rug, she&#146;s going to kill me.<br>
							<br>
							
						NEWMAN: He can&#146;t hear you, you idiot. Why don&#146;t you just buy another one.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Why would I buy another one when I spent a hundred bucks on this one?<br>
							<br>
							
						NEWMAN: I have a carpet sweeper you can use.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: I don&#146;t want a carpet sweeper. They don&#146;t do anything.<br>
							<br>
							
						NEWMAN: It gets my rug clean.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: The carpet sweeper is the biggest scam perpetrated on the American public since One Hour Martinizing.<br>
							<br>
							
						NEWMAN: Well, you should take a look at my rug then.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: I wouldn&#146;t set foot in your house.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Jerry enters)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hello.<br>
							<br>
							
						NEWMAN: Hello Jerry.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: How&#146;s he doing?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: He looks happy to me.<br>
							<br>
							
						NEWMAN: I hope he stays this happy when he wakes up.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Why wouldn&#146;t he?<br>
							<br>
							
						NEWMAN: No reason.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: He&#146;ll have a lot of catching up to do, I guess.<br>
							<br>
							
						NEWMAN: I&#146;ll bring him up to date.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: How up to date?<br>
							<br>
							
						NEWMAN: Oh, all the way up.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: And nothing could change your mind?<br>
							<br>
							
						NEWMAN: Well, it would take a hell of a lot. Because a friend is something you earn.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Okay, Jerry has a friend who has free tickets to the Cayman Islands for this weekend. He&#146;s not going.<br>
							<br>
							
						NEWMAN: I don&#146;t care much for the beach. I freckle. . . . Is that a,..<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Drake&#146;s Coffee Cake<br>
							<br>
							
						NEWMAN: Wow, where did you get that?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: From my house. I got a whole box of them.<br>
							<br>
							
						NEWMAN: Boy, that&#146;s the full size.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: That&#146;s your big boy.<br>
							<br>
							
						NEWMAN: Can I have a bite?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I don&#146;t give out bites. I got another one. But I&#146;m saving it for later.<br>
							<br>
							
						NEWMAN: Just one bite?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I don&#146;t think so. You know they, they&#146;re so fragile.<br>
							<br>
							
						NEWMAN: All right! All right. I won&#146;t say anything.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You swear?<br>
							<br>
							
						NEWMAN: I swear.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: On your mother&#146;s life?<br>
							<br>
							
						NEWMAN: On my mother&#146;s life.<br>

							<br>
							
						RULA: pew, pew, pew, pew (breathing)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: how did I know you were here? Something drew me here. This is phenomenal.<br>
							<br>
							
						RULA: The nurse said she would be right back. They&#146;re supposed to take me into the delivery room.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Oh, that&#146;s great. That&#146;s great. By the way I have to apologize for my friend the other day. Friend? Uh, uh I don&#146;t even know that woman. I met her on the bus on the way over. I couldn&#146;t get rid of her. Uh, My psychic instincts were a little off ..<br>
							<br>
							
						RULA: Oh, where&#146;s the nurse<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I don&#146;t know where the nurse is. Sweetheart why don&#146;t you get a nurse for mommy? &#133; Anyway I was just curious. Remember the other day you were saying something about my trip.<br>
							<br>
							
						RULA: Don&#146;t take that trip.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Yeah, why? Why?<br>
							<br>

							<br>
							
						(Martin&#146;s room &#150; Martin grabbing Jerry &#150; Elaine eating the Drake&#146;s Coffee Cake)<br>

						JERRY: What are you doing? We&#146;re going out to dinner in ten minutes.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I never assisted in a birth before. It&#146;s really quite disgusting.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What did she name the kid?<br>

						KRAMER: George, I would like to thank you for the greatest four days I ever spent in my life.<br>
							<br>

							<br>
							
						KRAMER: They were shooting the Sports Illustrated swim suit issue right in the hotel pool.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Woah. (hitting George)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Not only that but at the hotel they opened up this area on the beach for nude bathing and all of the Sports Illustrated models went down there.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Wow! (hitting George)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: I was on the next blanket from Elle McPherson<br>
							<br>

						KRAMER: She&#146;s a sweet kid.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Nude backgammon with swimsuit models!<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Oh, you know what? The second day I was there I stepped on a jellyfish. Now it kind of stung my foot. That&#146;s probably what Rula was trying to warn you about.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Yeah, you gotta&#146; watch for the jellyfish.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Yeah.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: What&#146;s this?<br>
							<br>
