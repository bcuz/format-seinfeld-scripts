						==================================================================<br>
							<br>
							
						[Opening Scene: Jerry and Elaine are outside, heading towards the apartment building]<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I hear you're going out with David Putty.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Yeah. What, is it a problem?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Well, I think he could've asked me. Supposed to be a friend of mine.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Well, I guess he figured you just wouldn't care. It *has* been a few years.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Elaine, you always care who an ex-girlfriend dates. You don't want it to be someone you know, and you don't want it to be someone better than you. Now, even though the latter is *obviously* impossible.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oh, god.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: The former still applies. I don't know what it is, but I just can't see you with a mechanic.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oh, yeah. Right, right. Well, all those mechanics do is work all day with their hands and their *big*, *muscular* arms on machines, and then they come home dripping with animal sexuality like Stanley Kowalski. What a huge turn-off that is.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: All right.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[At Monk's, George and Estelle are looking over their menus]<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Look at that. They got lobster on the menu. Who would order a lobster here. I mean, do they bring a lobster in everyday hoping *todays* the day.<br>
							<br>
							
						ESTELLE: So what if they have a lobster. Suddenly you're a shell-fish connoisseur.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: You know, I think we really need to be in front of a television set. You take T.V. out of this relationship, it is *just* torture.<br>
							<br>
							
						ESTELLE: So, I'm getting an eye job.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: An eye job? Ma, you don't need an eye job.<br>
							<br>
							
						ESTELLE: Georgie, I'm a divorcee.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: No, you're not a divorcee. You&yuml;re just separated. You're---you're a separatee.<br>
							<br>
							
						ESTELLE: Well, I'm out there, George.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: No, you're not out there.<br>
							<br>
							
						ESTELLE: I am, too!<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: You're not out there! You can't be, because *I* am out there. And if I see *you* out there, there's not enough voltage in this world to electroshock me back into coherence!<br>
							<br>
							
						ESTELLE: Well, anyway, the operation is on Tuesday and I need you to drive me home because I'll be all drugged up.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Tuesday? I can't do it Tuesday. Steinbrenner needs me to run---<br>
							<br>
							
						ESTELLE: This is the only time the doctor *has*.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer walks by their table on his way out)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Kramer, hey, hey! (Gets up out of his seat)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Hi, little buddy.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Come on over and sit down.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Hey, listen, I gotta go somewhere.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: No, you're gonna sit down, you son of a gun...<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: All right, I'm sitting down. How are you? (Kisses Estelle on the cheek)<br>
							<br>
							
						ESTELLE: So, Kramer. I'm getting an eye job.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Oh, yeah, good for you. Hey, you have to look your best. You're out there now.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: She's not out there!<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: So, who is your doctor?<br>
							<br>
							
						ESTELLE: Uh, Bakersoll.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: (whistles). He's good. He's *very* good. He worked on this kid from Guatemala with no nose. Turned him into Ricardo Montalban.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Hey, Kramer, what are you doing Tuesday?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Tuesday? Uh...<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Why doesn't *he* pick you up after the operation. He's got the car with the bench seats that you like.<br>
							<br>
							
						ESTELLE: Oh, I don't care.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Yeah, I know, but I can't drive anybody anywhere until I go down to the motor vehicle bureau and get my new plates.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Well, giddy-up!<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[At the motor vehicle bureau...]<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Yeah, I'm here to pick up my new plates. My name is Kramer. Cosmo Kramer.<br>
							<br>
							
						CLERK: Kramer.... (checks computer) All right...<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: All righty...<br>
							<br>
							
						CLERK: Sign right here, please. (hands over clipboard)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: (signs it) Okay. (The clerk hands him a manila envelope). Thanks. (opens up the envelope) Assman? Oh, no, these don't belong to me. I'm not the Assman. I think there's been a mistake.<br>
							<br>
							
						CLERK: What's your name again?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Cosmo Kramer.<br>
							<br>
							
						CLERK: (checks computer again) Cosmo Kramer. You *are* the Assman.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: No! I'm not the Assman.<br>
							<br>
							
						CLERK: Well, as far as the state of New York is concerned, you are.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Failing to clear up the mistake, Kramer drives off with the new plates attached)<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Meanwhile, we join Elaine and David---in bed, I should add. David, who apparently looks satisfied, is still breathless. Elaine, on the other hand, is looking somewhat, preoccupied]<br>
							<br>
							
						DAVID: How do you feel?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Fine.<br>
							<br>
							
						DAVID: Something the matter?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: No.<br>
							<br>
							
						DAVID: Then what is it?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: No, nothing.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Later on, at Monk's, Jerry has just come in to meet Elaine. He joins her at the booth]<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hi.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I was with David *Putty* last night.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yeah, so.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: He did the move.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What move?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: You know...*the* move.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Wait a second. *My* move?<br>
							<br>
							
						(Elaine nods).<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: David Putty used *my* move?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Yes, yes.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Are you sure?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Jerry! There is no confusing *that* move with any other move.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I can't believe it. He *stole* my move.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: What else did you tell (reaches over to slap Jerry) him. (does it again) The two of you must have had *quite* a little chat!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Oh, it wasn't like that! I didn't even mention you. You know, we were in the garage. You know how garages are. They're conducive to sex talk. It's a high-testosterone area.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Because of all the pistons and the lube jobs?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Well, I'm going down to that garage and telling him to stop doing it.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Well, wait---wait a second.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Isn't that a little...rash?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: No! He stole my move!<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Yeah, but...*I* like the move.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yeah, but it's like another comedian stealing my material.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Well, he doesn't even do it exactly the same. He--he--he uses a pinch at the end instead of the *swirl*!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Oh, yeah. The pinch. *I've* done the pinch. That's not new. Besides which, I don't know how you could trust any of his moves now. His whole *repertoire* could be lifted.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: You know, it's strange, because he's such an honest mechanic.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I know, he's probably the only honest mechanic in New York.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Later, Jerry and George are outside, where Jerry has just bought a candy bar at the newsstand]<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: ...so he stole my move and he's using it on Elaine.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: You told David Putty your move and you didn't tell *me*? I *need* a move. You know I have no moves, Jerry. (points to the candy bar) Gimme a bite.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Can I just get it opened first?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I can't believe you're hoarding sex moves. I'm out there rubbing two sticks together. You walk around with a zippo.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: All right, all right. Here. (hands George a piece of the candy bar).<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (takes a bite) Oh, that's good. That's very good.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You feel better?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Yeah, much better. All right, so what's the move, because I need *something*. This woman I'm dating, it's like she's doing her nails during love-making.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Nancy Klopper?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Yeah. Never seen anyone so bored. I'm working like a dog here. Give me a moan. *Something*. I'd settle for a belch, for god's sake. All right, come on, let's have it.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: All right, George. I'm gonna tell you. But I just wanna make sure, before---<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's in the vault. I'm putting it in the vault.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: It's not even a question of that. The point is when something like this is passed along, one must be certain that it's going to be used in a *conscientious* way. This is not some parlor trick to be used---<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: You're gonna tell me...or not.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: All right. On your bed. You got a headboard? You'll need a headboard.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I got a headboard.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Is it padded?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: No.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Good. How tall is she?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Five-foot four. Why?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You can't have more than a one-foot differential in your heights. Otherwise, you could really hurt your neck.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I can't tell ya how much I appreciate this.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: George, if you could master this, you'll never be alone again.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Back at Jerry's apartment: Jerry and George have just walked in, still conversing on the same subject]<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Now, the ending is kind of an option. I use the swirl. I like the swirl. I'm comfortable with the swirl. *I* feel the swirl is a great capper. He uses the pinch, which I find a little presumptuous.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Is it a clockwise swirl?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I prefer clockwise, but it's not written in stone.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer enters, holding an object of some kind).<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Here you go, buddy. (shows it to Jerry).<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What is it?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: *Fusilli* Jerry! It's made from Fusilli pasta. See the microphone?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: When did you do this?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: In my spare time. (turns to George). You know, I'm working on one of you, George. I'm using ravioli. See, the hard part is to find a pasta that captures the individual.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Oh... Why Fusilli?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Because *you're* silly. Get it? (hands the Fusilli to Jerry) Yeah...<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Well, thank you very much.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: So, did you get your new plates?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Oh...yeah. I got my new plates. But they mixed them up. Somebody got mine and I got their *vanity* plates.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: What do they say?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Assman.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Assman?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Yeah. Assman, Jerry. I'm Cosmo Kramer, the Assman!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Who would order a license plate that says &quot;Assman&quot;?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Maybe they're Wilt Chamberlain's.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: It doesn't have to be someone who gets a lot of women. It could be just some guy with a big ass.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Yeah, or it could be a proctologist.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yeah. Proctologist.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Come on! No doctor would put that on his car.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Have you ever *met* a proctologist? Well, they usually have a very good sense of humor. You meet a proctologist at a party, don't walk away. *Plant* yourself there, because you will hear the funniest stories you've ever heard. See, no one wants to admit to them that they *stuck* something up there. Never! It's always an accident. Every proctologist story ends in the same way: &quot;It was a million to one shot, Doc. Million to one.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						(A phone rings in the distant)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Oh! There's my phone. (He leaves)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: So, where you gonna stick this (points to the Fusilli Jerry)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I'll tell you where I'd like to stick it.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[We cut to the garage where David Putty is working on a car. Jerry walks in]<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hey, David.<br>
							<br>
							
						DAVID: Oh, hi, Jerry.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hey, what's the story? I hear you're doing my move.<br>
							<br>
							
						DAVID: What move?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What move? *My* move. The one I told you about. You used it on Elaine.<br>
							<br>
							
						DAVID: You're move? What, are you kidding? I was doing that before I knew you. All you told me about was the ending.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: The ending is the whole thing. Without the ending, it's nothing. You had *nothing*.<br>
							<br>
							
						DAVID: Oh, that ending was *so* obvious. I would have figured it out anyway. I didn't need you to tell me that stupid twist.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Swirl.<br>
							<br>
							
						DAVID: Whatever. I don't even do it.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Oh, yeah, I know. You do the *pinch*.<br>
							<br>
							
						DAVID: Yeah, that's right.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You can't come up with your own stuff , so you *steal* other peoples? You're nothing but a hack.<br>
							<br>
							
						DAVID: Are you through, 'cuz, uh, I gotta get back to work.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Well, I'll tell you what I'll do, you know. If you wanna do it out of town...okay. But not in the city.<br>
							<br>
							
						DAVID: All right, how about the next time your car breaks down, you take *that* out of town.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Fine.<br>
							<br>
							
						DAVID: Good!<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[While driving, Jerry hits a pothole and his car is now making a clanking noise]<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[We join George and Nancy, who are....getting busy under the covers.]<br>
							<br>
							
						NANCY: Ow, George! (crawls out from beneath the covers) What are you doing?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (pops his head out of the covers, looking a bit confused) Uh...you know, uh...pleasuring you.<br>
							<br>
							
						NANCY: Well, stop it!<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: You don't like the move?<br>
							<br>
							
						NANCY: No. I don't.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: You're kidding.<br>
							<br>
							
						NANCY: No, I'm not. It feels like aliens poking at my body.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Sorry. I'll just go back to my usual routine.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Back to Elaine and David in the middle of, uh...you know...]<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oh, god! Oh, god, Dave! Oh, yes! Yes!<br>
							<br>
							
						DAVID: No, I'm sorry.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: What?!!<br>
							<br>
							
						DAVID: I can't do the move.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: What?<br>
							<br>
							
						DAVID: Oh, he's ruined it for me.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oh, oh, come on, please?<br>
							<br>
							
						DAVID: No, he called me a hack. I'm just not into doing it anymore.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oh, so---so that's it?<br>
							<br>
							
						DAVID: I'll come up with some new stuff.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Cut to Kramer heading towards his car. He picks up a note on his windshield and reads it...]<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: &quot;Call me. Thirty-six, twenty-four, forty-six. I think I have what you're looking for.&quot; (Pleased by the note, Kramer stumbles into his car).<br>
							<br>
							
						(Meanwhile, Estelle is at Dr. Bakersoll's office)<br>
							<br>
							
						DR. BAKERSOLL: I must caution you about one thing. You can't cry for at least ten day. You can ruin the operation.<br>
							<br>
							
						ESTELLE: Oh, okay.<br>
							<br>
							
						DR. BAKERSOLL: Now, is someone coming to pick you up?<br>
							<br>
							
						ESTELLE: Yes, my son's friend should be here any minute.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[In the parking lot just outside, Kramer has pulls into a &quot;Doctors Only&quot; space]<br>
							<br>
							
						SECURITY GUARD: Can I help you?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Ah, yeah. Doctor Cosmo Kramer. (points to plate) Proctology.<br>
							<br>
							
						SECURITY GUARD: Oh, oh, okay. Sure...<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Thanks. Have a good day.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Kramer is driving Estelle home]<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: I just can't get over how fantastic you look.<br>
							<br>
							
						ESTELLE: Oh, really?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Oh, yeah. This takes twenty years off.<br>
							<br>
							
						ESTELLE: And it was all done by laser. I don't even need bandages.<br>
							<br>
							
						(As a car passes Kramer, someone yells out, &quot;Yo, Assman! Look at the Assman!&quot; Kramer waves).<br>
							<br>
							
						ESTELLE: Did he say &quot;Assman&quot;?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Oh, yeah.<br>
							<br>
							
						ESTELLE: Oh my goodness.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Another car passes: &quot;Hey, the Assman's in town!&quot;)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: You got that straight!<br>
							<br>
							
						ESTELLE: Boy. I never dreamed it could make such a difference.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer makes a sudden stop, and in a protective gesture, he sticks his arm out in front of Estelle.)<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Back to Jerry's apartment]<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You must have done *something* wrong. You probably screwed up the order. Did you close with the swirl?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Supposed to close with the swirl?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Oh my god. Yes, you close with the swirl. There's a progression there. I told you to write it down.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Yeah, yeah, should've written it down.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Bzzz. Jerry walks over to answer it)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yeah?<br>
							<br>
							
						BUZZER: Elaine.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: C'mon up. (turns to George) You know what? Do me a favor. Don't even do the move anymore. You're gonna give it a bad name.<br>
							<br>
							
						(The phone rings)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. What? Twenty-eight hundred dollars?!! That's the estimate on my car?!! No, don't even do anything. I'm gonna think about it. Okay, bye.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: What's to think about? If Putty says it's what it is, it's what it is. He's not gonna cheat you.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Except that it's not Putty.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: What happened to Putty?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Eh, we had a little fight about the move. I took her to this other place. I think they might be trying to screw me.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Well, of course they're trying to screw you. What do you think? That's what they do. They can make up anything. Nobody knows. &quot;By the way, you need a new Johnson rod in there.&quot; &quot;Oh, a Johnson rod. Yeah, well, you better put one of those on.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						(Elaine comes in looking a bit peeved)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hey, Elaine.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Yeah, yeah, hello.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Is it something I said?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Yes! As a matter of fact! David Putty won't do the move anymore.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Really?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oh, he's come up with some other move. You should see this thing.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What is it?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oh, it's a lot of just fancy-shmancy stuff. You know what it's like? It's like a big budget movie with a story that goes *nowhere*.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Huh.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I mean, this move is no good, Jerry. It's just taking up a lot of my time. And I...will not stand by and allow him to perform this move on me, when a perfectly good move is just sitting in the barn doing nothing!<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Let me ask you a question. This new move. Is there a knuckle involved in any way?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Yes. As a matter of fact, there is.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I think that's mine.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I'm not surprised.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Listen. I need you to do me a favor. When's the next time you're gonna see him?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Why?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You gotta get an estimate on my car from him. I think this garage is trying to screw me.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: An estimate? How am I supposed to do that?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Well, look. Here's the work order with everything that broke. Just kind of bring it up at the right time and find out. (hands Elaine the work order)<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: (takes the work order and points to the Fusilli Jerry sitting on the table) What? What is this?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: That's, uh, Fusilli Jerry.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Fusilli Jerry?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yeah. Kramer made it.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: All right, listen, I'll see you guys later.<br>
							<br>
							
						(As George is leaving, Kramer comes in with a female companion)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hey, Assman!<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Hey, well, this is Sally.<br>
							<br>
							
						SALLY: Hello.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hi.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Hi.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Shall we go?<br>
							<br>
							
						SALLY: Okay. (turns around and walks out with an exaggerated swing of her hips)<br>
							<br>
							
						(Elaine, Jerry, and George make a face)<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Back at the Costanzas' house...]<br>
							<br>
							
						ESTELLE: You can't face the fact that I'm improving myself.<br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: You're not the only one improving yourself. I worked out with a dumbbell yesterday. I feel *vigorous*.<br>
							<br>
							
						ESTELLE: Just take your mail and go home. I have things to do.<br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: I got things to do, too.<br>
							<br>
							
						ESTELLE: Don't upset me! I can't cry!<br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: Getting an eye job like some Manhattanite, huh?<br>
							<br>
							
						ESTELLE: Well, it's already working. Kramer made a pass at me.<br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: Kramer made a pass at you? You're crazy.<br>
							<br>
							
						ESTELLE: I'm not crazy. He stopped short and made a grab.<br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: He stopped short? That's my move. I'm gonna kill him!<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Once again, we join Elaine and David...in bed as usual...doing what they do best]<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Hey, let me ask you a question.<br>
							<br>
							
						DAVID: Sure.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: What do you charge for blown shocks?<br>
							<br>
							
						DAVID: What?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Two, three hundred?<br>
							<br>
							
						DAVID: I don't know. Maybe five hundred.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Ah.<br>
							<br>
							
						(They go back to kissing)<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: What about a bad gasket?<br>
							<br>
							
						DAVID: Bad gasket?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Yeah. Like a terrible gasket.<br>
							<br>
							
						DAVID: What is all this?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Nothing, nothing. I'm just taking an interest in what you...do.<br>
							<br>
							
						DAVID: What kind of car is it?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oh...any kind of---of a Swedish car.<br>
							<br>
							
						DAVID: All together, that could run about sixteen hundred.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oh.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kiss again)<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Is that with the parts and labor?<br>
							<br>
							
						DAVID: Uh-huh.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Hmm.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kiss...again)<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oh, no. No, David. No, please. Not the knuckle....<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Back to George and Nancy in bed. George is looking quite pleased with himself. Nancy, on the other hand, looks...bewildered...pleasantly surprised...]<br>
							<br>
							
						NANCY: Wow. That was...*great*. I mean...*wow*.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: It just came to me.<br>
							<br>
							
						NANCY: I---I've never in my life have---have I---. What was that?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: You mean in the end?<br>
							<br>
							
						NANCY: Uh-huh.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: A counter-clockwise swirl.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Spotting something on George's hand)<br>
							<br>
							
						NANCY: What's that?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: What?<br>
							<br>
							
						NANCY: On---on your hand? Let me see what's on your hand.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Nothing. I don't know...just a little dirt.<br>
							<br>
							
						NANCY: Give me that. (grabs his hand) I wanna see what's on your hand.<br>
							<br>
							
						(They struggle for a bit, but Nancy finally gets a hold of his hand and tries to make out the scribble)<br>
							<br>
							
						NANCY: Number one. Take her leg.... Oh, my god! Crib notes? You've got crib notes?!!<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: It's a very complicated move! I couldn't remember it all.<br>
							<br>
							
						NANCY: Oh, my god, you're sick. (gets out of bed)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: You know, it's not the S.A.T.s!<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Cut to Frank on the streets. He spots Kramer's car. He looks inside the back window and sees the &quot;Bro&quot;---or is it the &quot;Manssierre&quot;? He checks out the plates]<br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: Assman? I'll get him, Assman!<br>
							<br>
							
						(Back to Jerry's apartment)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Sixteen hundred dollars? That's all? *Ooh*, they are ripping me off.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: So what are you going to do?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Well, that's it. I'm going back to Putty. No move is worth this.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oh! You mean you don't care if he does the move anymore?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Are you kidding? He can do every move I've ever done! Do you know what a good mechanic is worth? You can't compare that to sex.<br>
							<br>
							
						(There's a knock at the door and Jerry goes over to answer it)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hi, Mr. Constanza. What's uh...?<br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: Where's your friend Kramer?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I don't know. Why?<br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: Because I'm looking for him. That's why. He stopped short.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What do you mean?<br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: In a car, with my wife. He stopped short. You think I don't know what that's about? That's my old move! I used it on Estelle forty years ago! I told everybody about it! Everybody knows! (Demonstrates) Hmmph! I stopped short.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Really, stopping short. That's a good move.<br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: You're not kidding it's a good move!<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer walks in.)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Hey.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hey.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Hey, Frank.<br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: Don't Frank me! I know what you did. How dare you stop short with my wife!<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: C'mon, Frank, relax. I don't even know what you're talking about.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Frank backs Kramer into the table, knocking the Fusilli Jerry to the floor)<br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: You think I don't know, Assman?!! To think I almost split the profits on the Manssierre with you.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Bro.<br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: Manssierre!<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Bro!<br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: Manssierre! You...!<br>
							<br>
							
						(Frank grabs Kramer by the collar and in doing so, he slips and falls right on top of the Fusilli Jerry)<br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: Aah!!!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Oh, my god!<br>
							<br>
							
						(Everyone gasps in horror, including George, who was just walking in at that very moment)<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[At the medical center, the gang is in the waiting room, waiting for the word on Frank's condition. Looks like they're still in shock<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: If I wasn't there, I wouldn't have believed it.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Me either.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: They say this guy's the best.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: He had to use cork-screw pasta.<br>
							<br>
							
						(At that thought, Jerry, George, and Elaine shift uncomfortably in their seats. Meanwhile, Kramer is checking out the pictures on the wall. He spots something...)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Jerry. Jerry, come here. Take a look at this.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Jerry joins him)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: The name on the boat. Look at it.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Assman!<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Yeah (points towards the doctor's office), he's the Assman! Jerry, *he's* the Assman!<br>
							<br>
							
						(The doctor walks in)<br>
							<br>
							
						DOCTOR: Which one is the son?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (stands up) I am.<br>
							<br>
							
						DOCTOR: Ah. I'm Doctor Cooperman. I just want you to know that this won't take long. And he's going to be fine.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer stops Dr. Cooperman at the door.)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Yeah, excuse me, uh... You didn't by any chance recently get the wrong license plates?<br>
							<br>
							
						DR. COOPERMAN: Yes. I'm still waiting for the motor vehicle bureau to straighten it out.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: So...you're the Assman.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Dr. Cooperman winks and heads back to where Frank is waiting)<br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: It was a million to one shot, Doc. Million to one.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Back at the Costanza's house, George and Frank are just walking in]<br>
							<br>
							
						ESTELLE: Where have you been?!! You were supposed to fix the stove! I've been waiting for hours!<br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: I fell on some Fusilli.<br>
							<br>
							
						ESTELLE: Fusilli?<br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: You know, the corkscrew pasta. It was a Fusilli Jerry. It got stuck in me. Had to go to the proctologist.<br>
							<br>
							
						ESTELLE: The proctologist? Are you okay?<br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: Yeah.<br>
							<br>
							
						ESTELLE: Oh, I was so worried. (grabs a couple of tissues from the box)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Ma, don't cry!<br>
							<br>
							
						ESTELLE: Oh, I can't help it!<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Ma, your eyes!<br>
							<br>
							
						ESTELLE: Oh!<br>
