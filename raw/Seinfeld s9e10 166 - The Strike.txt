						[Setting: Tim Whatley's apartment]<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: So.. Whatley's still Jewish, huh?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Oh, sure. With out the parents, it's a breeze.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Elaine laughs, Whatley enters)<br>
							<br>
							
						TIM: Hey! Happy Chanukah!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hey, Tim. Great party.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Tim holds up a mistletoe)<br>
							<br>
							
						TIM: (Suggesting a kiss to Elaine) eh?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: (Shrugging it off) eh.<br>
							<br>
							
						TIM: (Accepting) Oh. (Turns to George) Hey, George, thanks again for getting me those Yankee tickets.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Oh, yeah. Still in good with the ground crew. (Laghs)<br>
							<br>
							
						TIM: (Notices a woman walking by) Oh, hey, listen, I'd better circulate.. (moving over to the woman) Happy Chanukah, Tiffany! (they both move off camera)<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: This place is like Studio 54 with a menorah.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I'm gonna get some more of these kosher cocktail franks.. (leaves)<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oh.. (sees a guy looking at her) I got denim vest checking me out. (laughs) Fake phone number's coming out tonight.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You have a standard fake?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Mm-hmm.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (Notices an attractive woman walking by, starts to follow her) That's neat.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: (Holds onto Jerry's arm) No, please! Denim vest! He's smoothing it! Jerry! God! (Jerry excapes Elaine's grasp, moves over to the woman. The man wearing a denim vest moves over to Elaine.)<br>
							<br>
							
						DENIM VEST: Hi!<br>
							<br>
							
						(Scene cuts to Jerry talking to the woman)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hi, I'm Jerry.<br>
							<br>
							
						WOMAN: Hi. JERRY: You might not know it to look at me, but I can run really, really fast.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Scene cuts to Elaine)<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Nice vest. I like the.. big metal buttons<br>
							<br>
							
						DENIM VEST: They're snaps. Listen, maybe we should, uh, go out some time?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Why don't I give you my phone number?<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Setting: Coffee Shop]<br>
							<br>
							
						(George enters)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Hey.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hey! How'd it go with the cocktail franks?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Great! I ate the entire platter! Had to call in sick today.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Didn't you call in sick yesterday?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Hey, I work for Kruger Industrial Smoothing: &quot;We don't care, and it shows.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (Notices George brought hhis mail) You're gonna open your mail here?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Hey, at least I'm bringing something to this. (Starts flipping through envelopes, reads one ) &quot;Have you seen me?&quot; (Flicks it aside) Nope. (looks at next envelope) Woah, something from Whatley.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: See? You give, and you get.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (Reading the card from Whatley) &quot;This holiday season a donation has been made in your name to the Children's Alliance.&quot;?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Oh, that's nice.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I got him Yankee's tickets! He got me a piece of paper saying &quot;I've given your gift to someone else!&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: To a children's charity!<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Don't you see how wrong that is?! Where's your Christmas spirit? And eye for an eye!<br>
							<br>
							
						(Elaine enters)<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Hey!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hey.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Waitress moves tward the table)<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: (To waitress) Oh, nothing for me. (Waitress leaves) I'm going to &quot;Atomic Sub&quot; later.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: &quot;Atomic Sub&quot;? Why are you eating there?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I got a card, and they stamp it every time I buy a sub. 24 stamps, and I become a submarine (makes a gesture) captain.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What does that mean?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: (Embarrassed) Free sub.<br>
							<br>
							
						(George lets out a depressed sigh while reading a card)<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: What?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Nothing. It's a card from my dad.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: What is it? (Grabs the card from George, he tries to stop her, but fails. She reads it out loud.) &quot;Dear son, Happy Festivus.&quot; What is Festivus?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: It's nothing, stop it..<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: When George was growing up..<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (Interrupting) Jerry, No!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: His father..<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: No!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hated all the commercial and religious aspects of Christmas, so he made up his own holiday.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Ohhhh.. and another piece of the puzzle falls into place.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (pleading) Alright..<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: And instead of a tree, didn't your father put up an aluminum pole?<br>
							<br>
							
						(Elaine starts laughing uncontrollably - and continues to do so)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Jerry! Stop it!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: And weren't there a feats of strength that always ended up with you crying?<br>
							<br>
							
						(Jerry joins in with Elaine's laughter)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I can't take it anymore! I'm going to work! ARe you happy now?! (Gathers his things, and runs out of the coffee shop. Elaine and Jerry laugh hysterically)<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Setting: Jerry's apartment]<br>
							<br>
							
						(Elaine is digging into her purse)<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oh, I can't believe it! I've lost my &quot;Atomic Sub&quot; card!.. Oh no! I bet I wrote that fake number on the back of it when I gave it to denim vest!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: So?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I've eaten 23 bad subs, I just need 1 more! It's like a long, bad movie, but you want to see the end of it!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: No, you walk out.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Alright, then, it's like a boring book, but you gotta finish it.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: No, you wait for the movie!<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: (Irritated, and through clinched teeth) I want that free sub.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You don't need the card. High-end hoagie outfit like that, it's all computerized! (Snaps) They're cloning sheep now.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: (Correcting) No, they're not cloning sheep. It's the same sheep! I saw Harry Blackstone do that trick with two goats and a handkerchief on the old Dean Martin show!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: So, why don't you just try your blow-off number and see if he's called it?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: That's a good idea.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer's cordless phone rings, startling him. He digs through his coat, and pulls it out of the pocket)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: (Answering phone) Yeah, Go! Wha.. really? Yeah, ok. Yeah! Bye. (Hangs up) Great news! Yeah, the strike has been settled. I'm going back to work.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What strike?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Yeah, H&amp;H Bagels. That's where I worked.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Worked?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Bagels?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Yeah. Look, see. I still have my business card. (Pulls it out, hands it to Elaine) Yeah, we've been on strike for 12 years.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oh, I remember seeing those guys picketing out there, but I haven't seen them in a long time.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Yeah, well, H&amp;H wouldn't let us use their bath room while we were picketing. It put a cramp on our solidarity.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: What were your.. demands?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Yeah, 5.35 an hour. And that's what they're paying now.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I believe that's the new minimum wage.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Now you know who to thank for that!.. Alright, I've got to go. (Heads for the door)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Why didn't you ever mention this?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Jerry, I didn't want you to know I was out of work. It's embarrassing! (Leaves) (Scene ends)<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Setting: H&amp;H Bagel Shop]<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer walks through the door)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: All right, everybody! I'm back!<br>
							<br>
							
						MANAGER: Who are you?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Cosmo Kramer.. strikes over.<br>
							<br>
							
						MANAGER: Oh yeah! Kramer.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Huh.. wha- Didn't any of the guys come back?<br>
							<br>
							
						MANAGER: NO, I&quot;m sure they all got jobs.. like, ten years ago.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Oh, man. Makes you wonder what it was all for..<br>
							<br>
							
						MANAGER: I could use someone for the holidays..<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Alright! Toss me an apron, let's bagel! (Takes off his coat, puts it in the display case, then turns to see a plate full of bagels.) What are those?<br>
							<br>
							
						MANAGER: Those are rasin bagels.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: (Picks one up, he's mesmerized) I never thought I'd live to see that..<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Setting: Horse Track Betting]<br>
							<br>
							
						(Elaine confronts two unattractive bookies)<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: So, anyway, I've been giving out your number as my standard fake.<br>
							<br>
							
						BOOKIE: So. You're Elaine Benes. We've been getting calls fro you for 5 years.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: So, listen, when this guy calls, if you could just give him my real number..<br>
							<br>
							
						BOOKIE: (Interrupting) Hey, Charlie! Guess who's here. Elaine Benes.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Co-Worker in the back speaks up)<br>
							<br>
							
						CHARLIE: Elaine Benes?!<br>
							<br>
							
						(Various other men in the line behind Elaine say the same thing)<br>
							<br>
							
						BOOKIE: You make a lot of man friends. You know who's a man? Charlie here, he's a man. You know who else? Me. I'm a man.<br>
							<br>
							
						CHARLIE: (faintly) I'm a man.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Ohh.. my..<br>
							<br>
							
						BOOKIE: I'll have this best guy call your real number. You just, uh, give it to me. And that way, I'll have it. (Slides a pad over to Elaine so she can write it down)<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: My number? Ohh.. (looks at Kramer's business card) Okay.. Uh, well, there you go. (writes H&amp;H's number down) And, uh, tell you what.. (looks at the board in the back) put a sawbuck on Captain Nemo in the third at Belmont.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Setting: classy restaurant]<br>
							<br>
							
						(Jerry and Tim Whatley meet)<br>
							<br>
							
						TIM: Hey, Jerry.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hey, Tim.<br>
							<br>
							
						TIM: What's up?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Actually, I'm having dinner with a girl I met at your party.<br>
							<br>
							
						TIM: Mazel Tov.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Jerry's date, Gwen, arrives. She's completely unattractive)<br>
							<br>
							
						GWEN: Jerry.. hi.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Gwen?<br>
							<br>
							
						GWEN: Yeah.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (Not willing to believe how much uglier she is) Really?<br>
							<br>
							
						GWEN: Yeah! Come on, our table is ready.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Tim gives Jerry a face - almost like he feels sorry for Jerry)<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Setting: Jerry's apartment]<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: So, attractive one day - not attractive the next?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Have you come across this?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Yes, I am familiar with this syndrome -- she's a two-face.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (Relating) Like the Batman villain?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (Annoyed) If that helps you..<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: So, if I ask her out again - I don't know who's showing up: The good, the bad, or the ugly.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (Identifying what Jerry said) Clint Eastwood!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yeah.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Hey, check this out. I gotta give out Christmas presents to everyone down at Kruger, so I'm pulling a Whatley. (Give a Christmas card to Jerry)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (Reading it) &quot;A donation has been made in your name to the Human Fund.&quot; - What is that?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (With pride) Made it up.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (Continuing reading) &quot;The Human Fund. Money for people.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: What do you think?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: It has a certain understated stupidity.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (Once again, Identifying) The Outlaw of Josey Whales!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: ..Yeah.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Enter Kramer)<br>
							<br>
							
						(He is holding a sack full of bagels)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Ah, gentlemen.. bagels on the house!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: How was your first day?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Oh, fantastic! (Jerry and George both pick out a bagel) It felt so good to get my hands back in taht dough.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Jerry and George stop before they take a bite from their bagels)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Your hands were in the dough?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: No, I didn't make these bagels. (Jerry and George both take a bite) Yeah, they're day-olds. The homeless won't even touch them. (Jerry and George stop eating) Oh, we try to fool them by putting a few fresh ones on top, but they dig.. they, they test.<br>
							<br>
							
						(George spits his bagel out)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Alright. Uh, well, I'm out of here. (Gets up to leave)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Happy Festivus!<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: What's Festivus?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: When George was growing up..<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (Interrupting) No!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: His father..<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Stop it! It's nothing. It's a stupid holiday my father invented. It doesn't exist!<br>
							<br>
							
						(Elaine enters while George is exiting)<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Happy Festivus, Georgie.<br>
							<br>
							
						(George leaves yelling out &quot;God!&quot;)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Frank invented a holiday? He's so prolific!<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Kramer, listen, I got a little phone relay going, so, if a guy calls H&amp;H and he's looking for me, you take a message.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You're still trying to gget that free sub?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Hey! I have spent a lot of time, and I have eaten a lot of crap to get to where I am today. And I am NOT throwing it all away now.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Is there a captain's hat involved in this?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Maybe.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Setting: H&amp;H Bagel Shop]<br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: Kramer, I got your message. I haven't celebrated Festivus in years! What is your interest?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Well, just tell me everything, huh?<br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: Many Christmases ago, I went to buy a doll for my son. I reach for the last one they had - but so did another man. As I rained blows opon him, I realized there had to be another way!<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: What happened to the doll?<br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: It was destroyed. But out of that, a new holiday was born. &quot;A Festivus for the rest of us!&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: That musta been some kind of doll.<br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: She was.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Setting: Kruger Office Building]<br>
							<br>
							
						(George is in the hallway, dispensing his made-up gifts)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas! (Co-worker gives a gift to George) Oh, Sandy! Here is a little something for you.. (hands her a card)<br>

						GEORGE: The Human Fund.<br>

							<br>
							
						FRANK: And at the Festivus dinner, you gather your family around, and you tell them all the ways they have disappointed you over the past year.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Is there a tree?<br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: No. Instead, there's a pole. It requires not decoration. I find tinsel distracting.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Frank, this new holiday of yours is scratching me right where I itch.<br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: Let's do it then! Festivus is back! I'll get the pole out of the crawl space. (Turns to leave, meets up with Elaine)<br>

						KRAMER: No. (To manager of H&amp;H) Ah, listen, Harry, I need the 23rd off.<br>
							<br>
							
						MANAGER: Hey! I hired you to work during the holidays. This is the holidays.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: But it's Festivus.<br>
							<br>
							
						MANAGER: What?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: You know you're infringing on my right to celebrate new holidays..<br>
							<br>
							
						MANAGER: That's not a right.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Well, it's going to be! Because I'm going back on strike. Come on Elaine. (Takes of his apron, and goes for his coat) It's a walk out!<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: No, I got to stay here and wait for the call.<br>

						GWEN: (To driver) You know, you might want to take the tunnel.<br>

						(All the sudden, Gwen is extremely ugly)<br>

							<br>
							
						GEORGE: So, just bring her here. This is all you really need.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I can't just keep bringing her to the coffee shop. I mean, what if things, you know, progress?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Lights out.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Alright, I'll give it a shot! I do really like this coffee shop. Nice cuff links, by the way.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (Pointing to them) Office Christmas gift. I tell you, this Human Fund is a gold mine!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: That's not a french cuff shirt, you know.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I know. I cut the button off and poked a hole with a letter opener.<br>

						GEORGE: (Sulking) That's why I hate it.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: There's a big dinner Tuesday night at Frank's house - everyone's invited.<br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: George, you're forgetting how much Festivus has meant to us all. I brought one of the casette tapes. (Franks pushes play, George as a child celebrating Festivus is heard)<br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: Read that poem.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (Complaining) I can't read it. I need my glasses!<br>

							<br>
							
						KRAMER: (From a phone booth right outside the store) Elaine, you should get out of there. I sabotaged the bagel machine last night. It's going down.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: What did you do?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: You've been warned.<br>

							<br>
							
						GEORGE: 20 thousand dollars?<br>
							<br>

						GEORGE: I don't know.<br>

						GEORGE: I'm serious.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You're going to start your own charity?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I think I could be a philanthropist. a kick ass philanthropist! I would have all this money, and people would love me. Then they would come to me.. and beg! And if I felt like it, I would help them out. And then they would owe me big time! (Thinking to himself) .. First thing I'm gonna need is a driver..<br>

						KRUGER: George, I don't get it. If there's no Human Fund, those donation cards were fake. You better have a damn good reason why you gave me a fake Christmas gift.<br>

						(Cut to Frank)<br>

						FRANK: Welcome, new comers. The tradition of Festivus begins with the airing of grievances. I got a lot of problems with you people! And now you're gonna hear about it! You, Kruger. My son tells me your company stinks!<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Oh, God.<br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: (To George) Quiet, you'll get yours in a minute. Kruger, you couldn't smooth a silk sheet if you had a hot date with a babe.. I lost my train of thought.<br>

							<br>
							
						ELAINE: (To bookie) Hey, how'd my horse do?<br>
							<br>
							
						BOOKIE: He had to be shot.<br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: And now as Festivus rolls on, we come to the feats of strength.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Not the feats of strength..<br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: This year, the honor goes to Mr. Kramer.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Uh-oh. Oh, gee, Frank, I'm sorry. I gotta go. I have to work a double shift at H&amp;H.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I thought you were on strike?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Well, I caved. I mean, I really had to use their bathroom. Frank, no offence, but this holiday is a little (makes a series of noises) out there.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Kramer! You can't go! Who's gonna do the feats of strength?<br>
