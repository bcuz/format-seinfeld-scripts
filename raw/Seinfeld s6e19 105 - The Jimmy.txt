							<br>
							
						GEORGE: &quot; That guy was amazing, he could dunk and he was my height...What was his name again?&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: &quot;Jimmy&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: &quot;Jimmy, right.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: &quot;I dunno how you could forget . He kept reffering to himself in the third person. &quot;Jimmy's under the boards. Jimmy's in the open. Jimmy makes the shot.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: &quot;Ah! your just mad 'cause we beat ya.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: &quot;Jerry it's my fault .I couldn't make a shot. These losses they stay with me. They (?) Jerry. Now this is gonna plague me.&quot;( Puts on aftershave and cries out) OH! Mother!!!&quot;<br>
							<br>

						GEORGE: &quot;HEY! JIMMY!!! ha ha ha........Great game.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						JIMMY: &quot;OH yeah.......Jimmy played pretty good.&quot;<br>
							<br>

							<br>
							
						KRAMER: &quot;What d'you got there?&quot;<br>

						JIMMY: &quot;These are Jimmy's training shoes.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: &quot;Yeah,yeah yeah yeah! I've seen these.....they sorta ..they make your legs..stronger.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						JIMMY: &quot;Oh yeah! Jimmy couldn't jump at all before he got these. Jimmy was like you (looks at George)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: &quot;They're Plyometric.(sp?)&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: &quot;Plyometric?&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: &quot;Yeah! They isolate the muscles. The muscle has to grow....or die.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (to Jimmy) Wh...Where d'you get'em?&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						JIMMY: &quot;Jimmy sells'em.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: &quot;You sell them?&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						JIMMY: &quot;Oh yeah! But Jimmy's all out right now. Moving to Manhattan set Jimmy back a bit.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: &quot;Hey listen, let me give you my card. It's got my home number on it. I want to buy the first pair when the next shipment comes in.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						JIMMY: &quot;All right&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: &quot;All right Jimmy Good talking to ya.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						JIMMY: &quot;Jimmy'll see you around.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						(Jimmy leaves.)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: &quot;What day is today?....Aw. ..Tuesday! Damn it. I shouldn't have worked out today. Mr Wilhem has called a big meeting and now I'm gonna be sweating through the whole thing.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: &quot;Why. You took a shower?&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: &quot;Aahhrgh...it wouldn't take...... long pause, audience laughter) ten minutes from now, I'll be sweating all over again ,I can feel it. I'm a human heat pump!&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: &quot;You should take cold showers.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: &quot;Cold showers? They're for psychotics.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: &quot;Well I take 'em........They give me a Whooooosh.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: &quot;All right, I'll see you guys later.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: &quot;Aw right.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: &quot;So, you're heading home?&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: &quot;No...Got dental appointment.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: &quot;Ah! what.. Tim Whatley?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: &quot;Yeah!&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: &quot;Oh yeah.! I got a check up on Thursday.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: &quot;Oh! How d'you like that?&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: &quot;You know.. You really shouldn't brush 24 hours before seeing the dentist.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: &quot;I think that's eat 24 hours before surgery.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: &quot;Oh no, you got to eat before surgery, you need your strength.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer leaves. Jerry is speechless.)<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Meeting at Yankee Stadium.]<br>
							<br>
							
						WILHELM: &quot;I called this meeting because we......have........a problem. For the last few months someone has been stealing equipment from the club. Until recently it's been little things, y'know; bases, batting helmets, donuts, but two nights ago they pulled the big one. &quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						(The camera goes back and forth from Wilhem to George who keeps pulling on his collar he's sweating.)<br>
							<br>
							
						WILHELM: &quot;They took a pitching machine, a batting cage ,the in-field tarp and all of Mr Steinbrenner's vitamins.. Now , we have reasons to believe it's an inside job.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (still puffing)&quot; Whoa!!&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						WILHELM: &quot;If anybody here knows anything about it I recommend strongly that...you come forward.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						(Wilhem looks at George who's sweating so much it seems he's hiding something.)<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Scene cuts to Tim Whatley's dental office.]<br>
							<br>
							
						RECEPTIONIST: &quot;Dr Whatley's running a little late. If you'd like to take a seat, I'll call you when he's ready.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: &quot;All right.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						(Jerry sits down and browses through the magazine on the table and discovers Tim has Penthouse magazines for patients to read.)<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Scene then switches to Jerry's apartment. Elaine is on the phone.]<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: &quot;Oh! Okay. Right. Thanks Mr Pitt....'kay. ..goodbye.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: (to Jerry) &quot;Hey ! You want to go see &quot;The Velvet Fog&quot;.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: &quot;The Velvet fog?&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: &quot;Yeah! Mel Torm&eacute;, That's his nickname.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: &quot;What the hell his a velvet fog.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: &quot;Do you wanna go or not?&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: &quot;Well , where is it?.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: &quot;He's performing at this AMCA benefit.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: &quot;AMCA?&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: &quot;Able Mentally Challenged Adults&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: &quot;Naaaaaa...I can't watch a man sing a song.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: &quot;What are you..crazy?&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: &quot;They get all emotional , they sway. It's embarrassing.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: &quot;Well, what am I gonna do for a date.?...Oh! do you know that ..hemmm! blond guy who's always at the exercycle at the health club?&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: &quot;I don't think so.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: &quot;Yeah yeah! He's really handsome with those...&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (interrupting) &quot;Elaine , I really don't...............pay much attention to men`s faces.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: &quot;You can't find beauty in a man?&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: &quot;No... I find them repugnant and unappealing.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer bursts in)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: &quot;Hey!&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (pointing Kramer) &quot;To wit&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: &quot;What?&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: &quot;No ,Elaine and I we're just discussing whether I could admit a man is attractive.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: &quot; Hmm! Oh! Yeah. I'll tell you who is an attractive man; Gorge Will.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: &quot;Really!&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: &quot;Yeah! He has clean looks, scrubbed and shampooed and....&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: &quot;He's smart....&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: &quot;No, no I don't find him all that bright.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: &quot;So you got any cavities?&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: &quot;Just one....gotta go back.....Oh but get this. Elaine, you will appreciate this. I'm sitting in Tim Whatley's waiting room...He's got a Penthouse right out on the table.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: &quot;Penthouse?&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: &quot;Yeah!!! What is that? I mean isn't that sick. I mean , I'd be embarrassed to have that in my apartment.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: &quot;So what's wrong with that?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (outraged) He's a doctor!.I mean it's supposed to be like a sterile environment.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: &quot;So... Did you take a look?&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: &quot;Of course.... But that's got nothing to do with it.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: &quot;Well I'll tell you I'm looking forward to my appointment on Thursday. I might even get there a few minutes early.&quot;<br>
							<br>

						ELAINE: &quot;Hey! Hey! listen ... Do one of you guys know that ..that blond guy who's always on the exercycle at the health club. You know he's just really handsome?..&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (head down low) I...I wouldn't know&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: &quot;You know that just admitting a man is handsome doesn't necessarily make you a homosexual.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: &quot;It doesn't help&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: &quot;All right, I'm gone&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: &quot;I'll see you.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (to Jerry) &quot;You know those shoes that Jimmy had? I cut a deal with him. We're gonna import a case of them together.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: &quot;What are you doing that for, you got a job&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: &quot;There's a lot of money in this.. He's got a proven sales method&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: &quot; Yeah! What's that.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: &quot;He jumps!&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: &quot;Jimmy's got a record. Jimmy's jumping for dollars. Jimmt and George are gonna get rich.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: &quot;Will you stop with the Jimmies&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						Kramer takes something out of the fridge<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: &quot;Hey! What's this?&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: &quot;Kom Pau(sp?&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer tastes the chicken but realizes too late how hot and spicy it is)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: &quot;(gasp_)......Kom Pau........&quot;<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Elaine at the health club trying to attract the handsome blond guy's attention.]<br>

						ELAINE: (We hear what she thinks) Look at me....Look at Mee!. Come on. I'm stretching right in front of you. Heeeey!! ...a smile. Aah! we made contact, all right one more stretch and then go talk to him.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Hank leaves as she's ready to make her move. Elaine turns to try to find out where he could be and stops when she takes notice of Jimmy.)<br>
							<br>
							
						JIMMY: &quot;You know...Jimmy is pretty sweet on you.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: &quot;Aaaaaahhh! He is?!&quot;<br>

						JIMMY: &quot;Jimmy would like to get to know you.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: &quot;Ha....&quot;<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Scene cuts to Tim Whatley's office. Kramer is in the chair.]<br>
							<br>
