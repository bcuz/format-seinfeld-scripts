						[opening monologue]<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: The whale is supposed to be such an intelligent animal. You know you always here about how they can communicate by song from miles away. How extensive their vocabulary is. I would say from the rate we are pushing the whales off the beach back into the ocean the words shore and close do not appear to be in their vocabulary. I would say if the whales concentrate a little less on the singing and a little more on approaching Quervo beach volleyball tournament. If you wanna maintain the brainy mammal image.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[the bathroom]<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oh, I can't believe this. What a dope! uh..excuse me umm.. I'm sorry this is.. this is kind of embarrassing but.. there's no toilet paper over here <br>
							<br>
							
						JANE: (from the stall on Elaine's right) Are you talking to me? <br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: yeah.. I I just forgot to check so if you could just spare me some.<br>
							<br>
							
						JANE: No I'm sorry <br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: What? <br>
							<br>
							
						JANE: No I'm sorry, I can't spare it <br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: you can't spare it?? <br>
							<br>
							
						JANE: no there's not enough to spare <br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: well I don't need much, just 3 squares will do it <br>
							<br>
							
						JANE: I'm sorry I don't have a square to spare, now if you don't mind <br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: 3 squares? you can't spare 3 squares?? <br>
							<br>
							
						JANE: no I don't have a square to spare, I can't spare a square <br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: oh is it two-ply? cause it it's two-ply I'll take one ply, one ply, one puny little ply, I'll take one measly ply <br>
							<br>
							
						JANE: look, I don't have a square and I don't have a ply (flushing and leaving) <br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: No no, no no, don't don't, I beg you <br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[the movie theater]<br>
							<br>
							
						(Jerry's girlfriend, Jane, returns and sits down)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (eating pop corn) hmm I love this artificial flavoring I like it better than butter I think it's more consistent <br>
							<br>
							
						JANE: you would not believe what just happened to me in the bathroom <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: what? <br>
							<br>
							
						(offering pop corn to Jane) <br>
							<br>
							
						(elsewhere in the same theater) <br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: hey <br>
							<br>
							
						TONY: Hey. Hey? where is my popcorn babe? <br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: what? <br>
							<br>
							
						TONY: my popcorn, you were supposed to get me popcorn what? would you forget about me babe? <br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: you would not believe what just happened to me in the bathroom <br>
							<br>
							
						JANE: I mean.. a person needs a certain amount of toilet paper to be covered.. I simply could not spare it this woman just didn't get it, she kept harassing me <br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: 3 squares!! that's all I was asking for! 3 squares! <br>
							<br>
							
						JANE: she wouldn't stop &quot;help me! help me!&quot; she was insane <br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I was begging her &quot;please! please!&quot; she was insane <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: who do you think she is? how dare she? you want me to get the manager? too bad they don't have those old ladies walking around with flashlights anymore we'd flush her out <br>
							<br>
							
						JANE: I don't know what she looks like <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I wonder where Elaine is sitting? I really wanted you to meet her she's supposed to be here tonight with her new boyfriend Tony <br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: hmm where is Jerry sitting? he's supposed to be here tonight with his new girlfriend I'm dying to see what she looks like <br>
							<br>
							
						TONY: hey? you think if I jumped off that balcony I'd get hurt? <br>

						&nbsp;<br>
							<br>
							
						[Jerry's apt.] <br>
							<br>
							
						(Jerry's at his computer) <br>
							<br>

							<br>
							
						KRAMER: hey <br>

							<br>
							
						JERRY: hey where were you last night? I looked for you, I didn't see you <br>

						ELAINE: a square? <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: well, you know, sometimes a square is everything <br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: a ply? <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Elaine, you cannot judge a person on a situation like that. I mean it's like asking for someone's canteen in the desert <br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: yeah <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: it's battle conditions <br>

							<br>
							
						WOMAN'S VOICE ON THE PHONE: then we'll get a cab and we'll do it in the back seat.. how's that Andre? <br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Andre? <br>
							<br>
							
						(Jerry approaches and listens to the phone with Elaine) <br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: (on the phone) what about the driver? we could get an accident <br>
							<br>
							
						WOMAN so what? <br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: oh that wouldn't be very good <br>

							<br>
							
						[Jerry's car]<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: you know I hate to tell you this, but it's time to defrost that freezer <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I know, I just can't bring myself to do it meanwhile that freezer keeps getting smaller and smaller (she smiles) (Elaine looks at her watch) oh, don't wanna keep Tony waiting <br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: hey you got a problem with Tony? <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: hunky.. Tony.. hey hey hey (fools around with his collar again) <br>

						JERRY: I mean, every time I see him, it's Tony this, Tony that. George is like a school girl around him <br>

						&nbsp;<br>
							<br>
							
						[Monk's] <br>
							<br>
							
						TONY: so I said uh.. &quot;hey dude, you better step off&quot; <br>

						TONY: I really don't remember, I was kinda out of it for the 1st couple of days, I was on a lot of medication, it was kinda like haze, it was pretty cool <br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: huh (smiles) but huh, in this medicated haze, in this woozy state, um do you recall the words.. radical reconstructive surgery being uttered? <br>
							<br>
							
						TONY: I don't know, I don't know <br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: think Tony, think <br>
							<br>
							
						TONY: I'm drawing a blank, babe <br>
							<br>
							
						(knock on door) <br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Excuse me.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Elaine gets it, it's George) <br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Hi Elaine<br>

						&nbsp;<br>
							
						[Jerry's] <br>
							<br>
							
						(Jane is giving Jerry a massage) <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I've been waiting a while for this. You know it's a shame Tony got all banged up, we're not gonna be able to get together on Saturday night <br>

						JERRY: Ok.<br>

							<br>
							
						KRAMER: that's her <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: who? <br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Erika, she's Erika <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: oh you think she's Erika, the phone sex woman <br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Jerry, that voice is tattooed on my brain, I'm telling you it's her <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: oh you're crazy <br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Am I? Or am I so sane that you just blew your mind? <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: It's impossible <br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: iIs it? Or is it so possible your heard is spinning like a top? <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: it can't be <br>

						KRAMER: Can't it? Or is your entire world just crashing down all around you? <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: alright that's enough <br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: yeaaaaah! <br>
							<br>
							
						&nbsp;<br>
							<br>
							
						[Monk's] <br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: he's supposed to get the bandages off on Sunday.. what if? <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: what? <br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: you know (acts like a monster) <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: oh you're afraid he might look like Zippy the pinhead <br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: yeah I mean, I mean what is my obligation here, you know we were just dating, it was probably gonna be over in a couple of weeks anyway <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: oh I though you didn't care about his looks <br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I lied <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: aha <br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: are you kidding, he's a mimbo I know that.. but he's my mimbo, you know and even if he is a hideous freak maybe, maybe I can learn to love him, maybe in some final irony (Jerry is looking the other way), I'll learn what love really is. You know Jerry <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: oh I'm sorry I didn't get most of that.. isn't that Kramer over there? <br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: yeah, yeah <br>

						JERRY: what's all set? <br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Erika is gonna meet me here, now we're gonna find out the truth <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: how's you get her to meet here? <br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: I don't know, we have a certain chemistry <br>
							<br>
							
						(Jane shows up and when she sees Jerry, she walks by their table, smiling) <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: oh my god <br>
							<br>
							
						JANE: hi I thought I'd find you here <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: hello.. Erika <br>
							<br>
							
						JANE: Erika? what are you talking about? <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: how can u say things like that over the phone? <br>
							<br>
							
						JANE: what things? What are you talking about? <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: selling sexual pleasure over the phone? <br>
							<br>
							
						JANE: I sell paper goods you jerk <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: paper goods? <br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: excuse me, do you have a tissue? <br>
							<br>
							
						JANE: No, I'm sorry, I can't spare it, there's not enough to spare <br>
							<br>
							
						(Elaine realizes) <br>
							<br>
							
						JANE: Where's the ladies' room (Kramer points her) <br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I have to go to the bathroom too (runs to be ahead of Jane; Jane stops and looks back at Jerry; Jerry shugs) <br>
							<br>
							
						&nbsp;<br>
							<br>
							
						[monk's: the bathroom] <br>
							<br>
							
						JANE: oh damn <br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: something.. wrong? <br>
							<br>
							
						JANE: yeah there's no toilet paper in here, I usually check but would you mind? <br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I can't, I don't have it, I don't have a square to spare, I can't spare a square <br>
							<br>
							
						JANE: Hey, wait a minute, I know you <br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: that's right honey, and I know you! <br>
							<br>
							
						(Elaine gets out and she has an arms full of toilet paper) <br>
							<br>
							
						JANE: no, no, no!!! <br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Monk's]<br>
							<br>
							
						(Elaine after exiting the bathroom very satisfied, walks towards Jerry and gives him the rolls) <br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: here, take it <br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: thanks<br>
							<br>
							
						JANE: (walks out of the bathroom, very furious; to Jerry) don't call me anymore <br>
							<br>
							
						(Jerry doesn't say anything and waves his hands) <br>
							<br>
							
						(Jane walks by Kramer and turns back) <br>
							<br>
							
						JANE: (to Kramer, in a very sensual voice) you either <br>
							<br>
							
						(sticks her tongue out) <br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer and Jerry look at each other, with their mouths open) <br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Closing monologue]<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Now of the course the thing is Extreme sports. Bungie jumping. To me if Bungie jumping is a sport so is being a crash test dummy. Just leaning does not make it a sport. It's like a Wiley Coyote idea isn't it? The thing I wonder about the sky diving is why do they even bother with the helmets? Can you almost make it? Why don't they just wear a party hat? What's the difference? You jump out of a plane from twenty thousand feet in the air the chute doesn't open I got news for you, the helmet is now wearing you for protection. Later on the helmet's talking to the other helmets going &quot;boy it's a good thing he was there or I would have hit the ground directly.&quot; <br>
