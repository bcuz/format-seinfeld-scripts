						==================================================================<br>
							<br>
							
						[JERRY and ELAINE are walking down the street and Kramer is parking his car]<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Hey, good news. My dog problem has been solved.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Really? What happened?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Well, there's this rabbi in my building. You've met him. Very nice man.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Isn't he the one with the show on cable?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Yea, yeah, yeah,. So I spoke to him about the dog. He went down. Talked to the owner. She agr4eed to keep the dog inside from now on.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: That's great.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I know.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer crashing into parking spot)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: That looks pretty good.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: He's in.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hey, say, you know, we haven't even discussed George's engagement yet.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: What's to discuss?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Come on! GEORGE: is getting married!<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Is he happy?<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[At the restaurant! GEORGE: is coming from the bathroom to sit with his bride-to-be.]<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I will never understand the bathrooms in this country. Why is it that the doors on the stalls do not come all the way down to the floor?<br>
							<br>
							
						SUSAN: Well, maybe it's so you can see if there's someone in there.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Isn't that why we have locks on the doors?<br>
							<br>
							
						SUSAN: Well, as a backup system, in case the lock is broken, you can see if it's taken.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: A backup system? We're designing bathroom doors with our legs exposed in anticipation of the locks not working? That's not a system. That's a complete breakdown of the system.<br>
							<br>
							
						SUSAN: Can we change the subject, please?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Why? What's wrong with the subject? This is a bad subject?<br>
							<br>
							
						SUSAN: No, fine. If you wanna keep talking about it, we'll talk about it.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: It's not that I want to keep talking about it? just think that the subject should resolve itself based on its own momentum.<br>
							<br>
							
						SUSAN: Well, I didn't think that it had any momentum.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (To himself) How am I gonna do this? I'm engaged to this woman? She doesn't even like me. Change the subject? Toilets were the subject. We don't even share the same interests.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Jerry's]<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yeah, he seems pretty happy.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Well, that's all that counts, I guess.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What's the matter?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oh, nothin'.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Well, you don't seem too enthused about the whole thing.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Well, what do you want me to do?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Well, at least have some reaction to it.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: &#133;Well, I don't.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Maybe you're a little jealous.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oh, what? You think I wanna marry George?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: No! But maybe you wish it was you who was getting married, not him.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oh, please! That is the last thing that I want.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Oh, yeah. Right.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Yeah, right.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Lainy!<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Jerry!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You don't wanna get married?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Yeah, that's right. I don't wanna get married.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Oh, come on!<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oh, you come on.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You're such...<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer enters)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Oh, hey!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hey.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Elaine, listen, I was talking to a friend about this dog business. Do you realize this is gonna be on our permanent records? Are you aware of this?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oh, dear.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: It can never be erased. It'll follow us wherever we go for the rest of our lives. I'll never be able to get a job. I mean, doesn't that concern you? Everything I've worked for...down the drain because of one stupid mistake. I mean, aren't we entitled to make one mistake in our lives, Jerry?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: We're gonna change the system.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Yes!<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Well, I could care less. I hope it is on our record. I'm just sorry they didn't lock me up.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Outside Elaine's place]<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oh, hello, Rabbi Krischma.<br>
							<br>
							
						RABBI: ELAINE:! Always a pleasure to see you.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Thanks again for taking care of that dog for us.<br>
							<br>
							
						RABBI: Elaine, often times in life there are problems, and just as often there are solutions.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Yeah, I suppose.<br>
							<br>
							
						RABBI: Elaine, you don't seem yourself today. You seem, if I may say, troubled.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: No, Rabbi, I'm not myself.<br>
							<br>
							
						RABBI: Come upstairs. We'll have a talk.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[At Jerry's apartment. George trots in after his lunch with Kiki and Big Jer is kicking back with a paper.]<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hey!<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I want your honest opinion about something.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Have I ever been less than forthright?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: No, you haven't. Well, maybe you have. What do I know.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yeah, I probably have. Yeah, of course I have. What am I talking about?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: All right. Okay, tell me what you think about this idea: Extend the doors on the toilet stalls at Yankee Stadium all the way to the floor.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Extend the doors on the toilet stalls at Yankee Stadium to the floor ...door comes down. Hides your feet. Yes. I like it. I like it a lot.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: It's good, right?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I think it's fantastic. I think it's a fantastic idea.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: You do?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yes, I do.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Well, I told it to Susan before, and she didn't like it.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hmm.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Yeah. Not only that, this is what she said to me, &quot;Can we change the subject?&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: See, now that I don't care for.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Right. I mean, we're on a subject. Why does it have to be changed?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: It should resolve of its own volition.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: That's exactly what I said, except I used the word &quot;momentum&quot;.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Momentum - same thing.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Same thing. My god, I'm getting married in December, do you know that?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yeah, I know.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Well, I don't see how I'm gonna make December. I mean, I need a little more time. I mean, look at me I'm a nervous wreck. My stomach aches. My neck is killing me. I can't turn. Look. Look.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You're turning.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Nah, it's not a good turn. December. December. Don't you think we should have a little more time just to get to know each other a little.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: If you need more time, you should have more time.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: What, you think I could postpone it?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Sure you can. Why not?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: That's allowed? You're allowed to postpone it?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I don't see why not.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: So, I could do that?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Sure, go ahead.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: All right! All right. I'll tell you what. How about this? Got the date; March 21st, the first day of spring.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Spring. Of course.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Huh? You know? Spring. Rejuvenation. Rebirth. Everything's blooming. All that crap.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Beautiful.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: She's not gonna like it.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: No, she's not.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: You know, I think I'm a little bit scared of her. She's five-three, like a hundred pounds. I'm frightened to death of her.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Well, she's a woman. They don't like to be disappointed.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Especially her. She does not like disappointment. Well, I have to do it. I can't make December. There's no way I can make December. Right? I mean, you can see that, right? I mean, look at me. Look. Look. Can I make December? I can't make December. Right? Look. Look.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yeah, you'd better shoot for March.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer enters)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Hey, hey.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: March 21st. Hey! So, you're gonna back me on this, right?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Oh, all the way.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: You are a good friend. You know what? Even if you killed somebody I wouldn't turn you in.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Is that so?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hey, Kramer if I killed somebody would you turn me in?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Definitely.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You're kidding?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: No, no, I would turn you in.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You would turn me in?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Phwap, I wouldn't even think about it.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I can't believe your a friend of mine.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: What kind of person are you going around killing people?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Well, I am sure I had a good reason.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Well,, if you'll kill this person, who's to say I wouldn't be next?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: But you know me!<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: I thought I DID!<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Rabbi's apartment]<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I'm not a very religious person but I do feel as if I'm in need of some guidance here.<br>
							<br>
							
						RABBI: Would you care for a snack of some kind? I have the Snackwells which are very popular but I think that sometimes with the so called fat free cookies people may overindulge forgetting they may be high in calories<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Thank you I am not very hungry. Anyway, um, this friend of mine, George, got engaged .<br>
							<br>
							
						RABBI: How wonderful.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Yeah, yeah, well, for some reason, um, I just find myself just overcome with feelings of jealousy and resentment.<br>
							<br>
							
						RABBI: Doesn't it give you any joy to see your friend enter into this holiest of unions?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: No, no, no it doesn't. No joy no joy whatsoever. Just the whole think makes me . . sick.<br>
							<br>
							
						RABBI: You know, Elaine, very often we cannot see the forest for the trees.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Yeah, I don't know what that means.<br>
							<br>
							
						RABBI: Well, for example, say there's a forest, . . .<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: You see the thing is we It should have been me. You know, I'm smart. I'm attractive.<br>
							<br>
							
						RABBI: You know my temple has many single functions.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: No, no, it's okay.<br>
							<br>
							
						RABBI: My nephew Alex is someone who is also looking perhaps &#133;<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I don't think so.<br>
							<br>
							
						RABBI: He owns a flower store. Very successful.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Outside Coffee shop]<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: So you're nothing but a stoolie. Admit it.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Hey, don't do the crime if you can't do the time.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Another Caf&eacute; Latte?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: You better believe it.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Since when are you so trendy?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hey, baby. I set the trends. Who do you think started this whole Caf&eacute; Latte?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I don't recall you drinking Caf&eacute; Latte.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: I've been drinking Caf&eacute; Latte since the fifth grade and I haven't looked back.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hey, Planet 9 From Outer Space is playing tomorrow night. One show only.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: I've always wanted to see this.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You know I was supposed to see this five years ago. I was in a Chinese restaurant with George and Elaine and got all screwed up trying to get a table and I missed it.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Well, yeah, lets do it uh?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Look at this Jerry, dropping paper on the ground. That's littering.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Maybe you better call the cops and turn me in.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Maybe I will.<br>
							<br>
							
						&nbsp;<br>
							<br>
							
						[George's]<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Hi,<br>
							<br>
							
						SUSAN: How was your day?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Good, good day. How was your day?<br>
							<br>
							
						SUSAN: Mine was okay. So what's goin' on?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Oh, nothin' much. I went over to jerry's, uh, talked to Jerry.<br>
							<br>
							
						SUSAN: Oh, the Lowers want to get together with us on Friday night.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: The Lowers, really?<br>
							<br>
							
						SUSAN: You don't want to go?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: No, I want to go.<br>
							<br>
							
						SUSAN: So what did Jerry have to say?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Oh, nothin' much, . . . talkin'. . . . Oh, oh, oh, did I have an unbelievable idea today!<br>
							<br>
							
						SUSAN: Oh, yeah, the toilets. You told me.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Yeah, ha ha, It's not the toilets, it's not the toilets. It's something else. Are you ready for this?<br>
							<br>
							
						SUSAN: Yeah.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Okay, how about this? All right, we get married March 21st, the first day of Spring.<br>
							<br>
							
						SUSAN: What do you mean? You want to postpone the wedding?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: No, no no it's not about postponing. I just think the first day of Spring is the perfect day to get married. You know, Spring! Rejuvenation! Rebirth! Everything is blooming all the &#133;<br>
							<br>
							
						SUSAN: If you don't want to marry me, George, just say so. (crying) Say so.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Still marry , still marry.<br>
							<br>
							
						SUSAN: You don't love me.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Sstill love. Still love.<br>
							<br>
							
						SUSAN: My parents told me you were too neurotic and that I was making a mistake.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: No no no, no mistake, no mistake. No, no , listen, we're going to get married over Christmas, I &#133;It doesn't make any difference to me. It's fine. Really.<br>
							<br>
							
						SUSAN: Are you sure?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Yeah, yeah, sure, Christmas. Snow. Santa. All that stuff.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Monk's]<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Let me take a guess. She cried and you caved.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: How did you know that?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I live and breath my friend. . . . I live and breath.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I got to tell you I felt terrible. I really thought she was going to collapse and kill herself.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: tes, it's very difficult. Few men have the constitution for it. That's why breakups take two or three tries. You gotta build up your immunity.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: You see those tears streaming down you don't know what to do. It was like she was on fire and I was trying to put her out.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Well, at least you probably had some, uh, pretty good make-up sex after.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I didn't have any sex.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You didn't have make-up sex? How could you not have make-up sex? I mean that's the best feature of the heavy relationship.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I didn't have make-up sex.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: In your situation the only sex you're going to have better than make-up sex is if you're dent to prison and you have a conjugal visit.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Yeah, conjugal visit sex. That is happening!<br>
							<br>
							
						WOMAN: (crying)<br>
							<br>
							
						MAN: I can tell you're very upset but I'm sorry I'm not goin'<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Did you here that? I can't believe this he's eating his sandwich.<br>
							<br>
							
						MAN: Are you going to eat thoise fries?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: This is amazing. (George gets up to leave and shake's man's hand) Thank you. Thank you very much. . . . I'm going back in! . . . You'll feel better (to woman)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: . . . Poor bastard.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Outside Elaine's]<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Good evening, Rabbi.<br>
							<br>
							
						RABBI: Good evening. And how does this evening find you?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Well, Rabbi, well.<br>
							<br>
							
						RABBI: I trust you are here to see your friend, Elaine.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yeah, that's right.<br>
							<br>
							
						RABBI: I hope she's feeling better.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What do you mean?<br>
							<br>
							
						RABBI: She didn't tell you?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: No.<br>
							<br>
							
						RABBI: Well it seems the engagement of her ffriend George has left her feeling bitter and hostile.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: is that so?<br>
							<br>
							
						RABBI: Yes, in fact she told me that she wishes she was the one getting married.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Really?<br>
							<br>
							
						RABBI: She came off as pretty desperate.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I didn't know any of this.<br>
							<br>
							
						RABBI: Apparently she doesn't think much of this George fellow either. I recall the word loser peppered throughout her conversation.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hum, well it all comes as news to me.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[George's apartment]<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (enters) Hi.<br>
							<br>
							
						SUSAN: Hi, how was your day?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Good, good day. How was your day?<br>
							<br>
							
						SUSAN: Ah, it was okay. What's going on?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Oh, nothing much. You know, I went over to Jerry's. Talked to Jerry. Um, could I talk to you for a minute?<br>
							<br>
							
						SUSAN: Yeah, sure.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: You see this is the thing. . . . (crying) I just feel . . . mumble, cry, mumble, . . . I'm scared. You and I together, (cry)<br>
							<br>
							
						SUSAN: George, of course, of course it can wait until march if that is what you want.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Yeah?<br>
							<br>
							
						SUSAN: Oh, don't worry your head. Of course.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: All right. (smiles behind her back)<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Elaine's]<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I've got that magazine article for you.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You iknow I talked to the rabbi outside.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Are you<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Understand you had a little talk with him too.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Yeah, talked earlier.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yes I know, I know.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE:. . . What does that mean?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Nothing, nothing.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: He didn't mention . . .<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yes he did.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: He told you about our conversation?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: We had quite a little chat.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: He told you about . . .<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yes, about how you're very jealous of George. How you wished it was you who were getting married instead of him.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: He told you all that? How could he?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: It didn't take much prodding either, I must say.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Can he do that?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: He did it.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: But he's a Rabbi! How can a Rabbi have such a big mouth?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: That's what's so fascinating.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Movie line)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You better finish your little caf&eacute; latte there. They won't let you in with it.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Why not?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Because they don't allow outside drinks into the movie.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Well that's stupid<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: That's the rule.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Well, we'll just see if we can't get around that.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer puts coffee cup into his pants)<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Rabbi's apartment]<br>
							<br>
							
						RABBI: Oh, Elaine. Come in. Come in. So nice to see you again.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Yeah&#133;<br>
							<br>
							
						RABBI: Can I offere you some Kasha Varnishkas?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: No, no. Listen, Rabbi, I'd like to ask you a question. Why, why did you tell my friend Jerry what I talked to you about?<br>
							<br>
							
						RABBI: Was that a problem for you?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Of course it was a problem for me. . . . You didn't, you didn't tell anyone else about this, did you?<br>
							<br>
							
						RABBI: Well, let's see? I seem to recall a conversation with Mrs. Winston in 1F.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Mrs. Winston?<br>
							<br>
							
						RABBI: Yes, we were waiting for our mail to arrive and I happened to mention to her how you felt that it was never going &quot;to happen&quot; for you.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: What about Don Ramsey? You didn't mention anything to him did you?<br>
							<br>
							
						RABBI: Don Ramsey?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: You know that tall really good looking guy, he lives on the fifth floor.<br>
							<br>
							
						RABBI: Oh him! Well this morning I found myself in the elevator with him&#133;<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: my god, you didn't.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Movie theatre)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Oh, yow, oow Ah!<br>
							<br>
							
						USHER: Hey, hey, what's going on? What just happened here?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Nothing Nothing.<br>
							<br>
							
						USHER: Whatya got? One of those Caf&eacute; Latte's in your shirt?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: I don't have anything. Ask him.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Jerry makes a silent drink gesture)<br>
							<br>
							
						USHER: All right, come on Coffee Boy, bring it out.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: What?!<br>
							<br>
							
						USHER: Here you go.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Ow<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer leaves)<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Jerry's apartment]<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: But the whole thing is a mess. He told everyone in the building. I met that cute guy on the fifth floor. I mean he could barely bring himself to nod.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Elaine, if I could say a word here about Jewish people. That man in no way represents our ability to take in a nice piece of juicy gossip and keep it to ourselves.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: You didn't say this to George, did you?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: No, . . . about how you wish it was YOU who was getting married instead of him? Feelings of resentment, hostility?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Yeah that! So, . . .<br>
							<br>
							
						(George enters)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Hey oh.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: GEORGIE! CONGRATULATIONS! Oh, my god. I haven't seen you since it happened. I'm so happy for you.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Alright, thanks a lot.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oh, come on. You really, really deserve it.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Gives George a kiss)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Oh, deserve! I don't know if I deserve...I mean...<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Are you kidding? I have seen the changes in you the past couple of years. Man, you have grown. You've matured.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Well, I guess I'm getting older.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oh! Well, I just think it's wonderful. Honestly! I've gotta run, but um, please, please give my best to Susan.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Yeah.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: My most, just heartfelt congratulations.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Yeah. Thanks. Hey, listen, if you ever get a date, maybe the four of us could go out together sometime.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Yes! Yes, yes. Sure.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Wait, as a matter of fact, wasn't there some guy in your building that you said you liked? He lived up on the fifth floor or something.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Yes. Yes, yes. Yes.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Yeah! Boy, she is something, isn't she?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yeah, she's something else. Hey, so what happened? Did you hold your ground or...uh&#133;<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Nope. I wept like a baby.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Well, I started to tell her and then all of the sudden, for some reason, I just burst into tears.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You cried?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I bawled uncontrollably. I just poured my guts out. And I'll tell you, Jerry, it was incredible. I never realized how powerful these tears are. I could have postponed it another five years if I wanted to.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY, GEORGE, &amp; KRAMER: Hey!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Sorry about that movie-thing. I was joking around.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Sorry? Are you kidding? You did me the biggest favor of my life. I spoke to a lawyer, we're suing for millions.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Suing? What for?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: The coffee was too hot.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: It's supposed to be hot.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Not THAT hot.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[At George's home. He and Susan are in bed watching TV]<br>
							<br>
							
						RABBI: (On TV) The prophet Isaah tells us without friends our lives are empty and meaningless.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Wait. Whoa! That's the Rabbi from Elaine's building. I just met this guy the other day.<br>
							<br>
							
						RABBI: A young lady I know, let's call her Elaine, happened to find herself overwhelmed with feelings of resentment and hostility for her friend, let's call him George. She felt that George was somewhat of a loser and that she was the one who deserved to be married first. She also happened to mention to me that her friend had wondered if going to a prostitute while you're engaged is considered cheating. His feeling was they're never going to see each other again so what's the difference. But that is a subject for another sermon. Now, I'd like to close with a psalm.<br>
