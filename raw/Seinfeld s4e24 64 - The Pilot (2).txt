						[setting: NBC, pilot's set]<br>
							<br>
							
						(Jerry, Tom, and Michael are at the counter, rehearsing. George is standing and watching them next to another guy. Rita, Jay, Stu and Russell are sitting in the crowd's bleachers)<br>
							<br>
							
						TOM: What do you mean made up?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: It's made up. Haagen-Dazs is made up. It's not Danish.<br>
							<br>
							
						TOM: You're crazy.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: No I'm not. (to Michael) George. Is Haagen-Dazs Danish?<br>
							<br>
							
						MICHAEL: What do you mean Danish?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (to the guy next to him) This guy stinks. (speaking of Michael)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Danish. Is it from Denmark?<br>
							<br>
							
						MICHAEL: No, they make it in New Jersey. It's just a Danishy name.<br>
							<br>
							
						TOM: I can't believe that. They fooled *me* Jerry.<br>
							<br>
							
						RITA: (to Jay) Boy, talk about a show about nothing. (Jay, the integral producer, smiles stupidly)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Uh, excuse me. (stopping them from rehearsing) Excuse me. (he walks to the guy's in charge of yelling: &quot;take #!&quot;) This--This is not right. May I? (the guy looks at George with a bothered face. George then walks up to Tom and takes him away from Jerry and Michael to talk to him in private)(to Tom) You see, you're going: &quot;They fooled *me* Jerry!&quot; (George shakes his head with disapproval) You wanna hit 'fooled' more: &quot;They *fooled* me Jerry!&quot;. You see the difference?<br>
							<br>
							
						TOM: I'm not gonna say it like that.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Just a suggestion. (chuckles and walks back to the yelling guy)<br>
							<br>
							
						YELLING GUY: (with the same bothered face and while he's looking at George) All right everybody, take a five.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (very casual and raising his hand in the air) Yep. That's five!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: George? (walks away to talk privately. George, still casual, taps on Jerry's shoulder) I don't have a lot of experience with this acting stuff. But from what I can gather, they're a little touchy about being told how to say the lines.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Why is that?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I don't know, but they don't seem to like it. By the way how am I doing?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Oh, you're fine... you're fine. (looking at Tom in the back and then quieter to Jerry) So you think this guy playing Kramer took the raisins?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Why would he steal a box of raisins?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Yeah, it's bizarre. (they both look around them suspiciously)<br>
							<br>
							
						(scene cuts to the bleachers with the producers)<br>
							<br>
							
						RITA: (to Jay about Russell) What's with him? (to Russell) Russell? (louder) Russell?<br>
							<br>
							
						RUSSELL: What?<br>
							<br>
							
						RITA: You O.K.?<br>
							<br>
							
						RUSSELL: Yeah. No, uh, I was just thinking of something. I'll be back in a second. (he gets up and leaves)<br>
							<br>
							
						(scene cuts to Jerry sitting next to Sandi. They're both going through their copy of the script)<br>
							<br>
							
						SANDI: What's the matter?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Nothing.<br>
							<br>
							
						SANDI: You're acting weird. Is anything wrong?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: No.<br>
							<br>
							
						SANDI: Are you breaking up with me?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Are we going out?<br>
							<br>
							
						SANDI: You're breaking up with me, aren't you? (almost crying)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Do you want me to break up with you?<br>
							<br>
							
						SANDI: If that's what you want.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I don't even know what you're talking about.<br>
							<br>
							
						SANDI: Fine. Break up with me.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: All right. We're broken up.<br>
							<br>
							
						SANDI: (little pause) Can we still be friends? (Jerry raises his head, staring ahead and wondering what's going on)<br>
							<br>
							
						(scene cuts to George and Tom standing, backstage)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Remember when you came to audition for us?<br>
							<br>
							
						TOM: Yeah.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: There was a box of raisins on the coffee table. Did you, by any chance, take them with you when left?<br>
							<br>
							
						TOM: What are you talking about?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Well we were all eating the raisins. And I remember you--you were eating some of the raisins. And then you left, and the raisins were gone. And I was just wondering if, you know (chuckles), maybe you took them with you.<br>
							<br>
							
						TOM: Are you accusing me of stealing the raisins?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Oh, no, no--<br>
							<br>
							
						TOM: (angry) Why would I steal a box of raisins!?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: No you wouldn't. Nobody would. It's just that... they were missing, and... well I'm just inquiring. (chuckles nervously)<br>
							<br>
							
						TOM: Let me give you a word of advice. O.K.? I want you to stay away from me. I don't wanna talk to you, and I don't wanna hear anymore of your stupid little notes and suggestions. I don't like you. So if you got any other problems whether it's raisins, prunes, figs, or any other dried fruit, just keep it to yourself and stay out of my way, O.K.?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. All right. I don't think we're gonna have any problem with that. (chuckles nervously) Good talking to you Tom. Really.<br>
							<br>
							
						(scene cuts to Russell, still on the set, but on the phone with Elaine)<br>
							<br>
							
						RUSSELL: (nervously, almost desperately) Elaine. Elaine. What do you want? What can I do? Is it my job? Is that what it is? Elaine I can't go on like this. Will you call me? Would you call me? Well, why? All right. May I call you? Elaine? Elaine? (she hung up. An employee walks by, bumps into Russell and spills coffee accidentally on him)<br>
							<br>
							
						DAVID: Excuse me Mr. Dalrimple. I am so sorry.<br>
							<br>
							
						RUSSELL: All right. All right. What's your name?<br>
							<br>
							
						DAVID: David Richardson.<br>
							<br>
							
						RUSSELL: Get out! You're fired!<br>
							<br>
							
						DAVID: But Mr. Dalrimple--<br>
							<br>
							
						RUSSELL: Don't talk back to me. Didn't you hear what I say? Get out! You want me to call the cops? I make and break little worms like you every day. Do you know how much money I make? Do you have any idea! Do you know where I live? I can have any woman in this city that I want. Any one. Now, GET OUT! (David leaves. Everyone on the set is looking at Russell) What are you all looking at? Go back to work! BACK! NOW! (they do, Russell leaves)<br>
							<br>
							
						(scene ends)<br>
							<br>

						[setting: Jerry's]<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: The doc called and said the lab's backed up and now I'm not gonna get the results for another two days.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Ah! You're fine. There's nothing wrong with you. I'm the one who's dying.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: What do you mean?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Because I can't act! I stink! I don't what I'm doing!<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Come on you're... uh... you're fine.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: This show's gonna ruin my entire career. I don't know how I got involved in this.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: What about me? I was a total failure. Everything was fine. Now this thing's gonna be a success and God's gonna give me a terminal disease.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: This actress playing Elaine, she's out of her mind.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: The guy playing Kramer threatened me.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Why?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: 'cause I asked him about the raisins.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You mentioned the raisins.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Oh yeah.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Did he take 'em?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I don't know.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Well if he didn't take 'em, what happened to 'em?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: That's what I'm trying to find out.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer enters slowly and carefully)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hey.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Hey.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Any luck?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: No. No, nothing. I got no... peristalsis.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What about bran?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: I tried bran-- 40%, 50% 100%. The bran isn't working for me.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Well my friend, (Jerry puts his hand on Kramer's shoulder) it may be time to consider the dreaded apparatus.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Pfft! Hold it right there. If you're suggesting what I think you're suggesting, you're wasting your time. I am not Jerry, under any circumstances, doing any inserting in that area.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Oh, it's not that bad!<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Yes it is.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Elaine enters)<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Well it's all taken care of. I filed a report. An investigation is underway.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (to Elaine) So, you going to the taping tomorrow night?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: No. I don't think I should go. I really don't wanna bump into Russell. He called me the other day. He won't quit.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Oh, come on you gotta go! He's harmless. He's got a little crush on you.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Jerry, this is not a crush. This is a complete fixation. he makes me very uncomfortable.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: We need you there!<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: (to Kramer) Hey are you gonna go?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: No. No. I'm gonna stay home. I want to be close to my home base in case there's any news from the front. (he leaves)<br>
							<br>
							
						(scene ends)<br>

						[setting: NBC, pilot's set, the taping]<br>

						Jerry is getting a makeup.<br>
							<br>

							<br>
							
						Scene cuts to the drugstore where Kramer is buying the dreaded apparatus.<br>
							<br>
							
						Sandi, sitting next to Jerry who's still getting a makeup, is having her hair done.<br>
							<br>
							
						SANDI: (to her hairdresser) No! Pick it up more in the front! It's got to be higher! Higher! Make a wall! A wall!<br>
							<br>
							
						ASSISTANT DRESSER: Sandi, are you in wardrobe? Sandi?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Try Elaine.<br>
							<br>
							
						ASSISTANT DRESSER: Elaine?<br>
							<br>
							
						SANDI: Yes?<br>
							<br>
							
						(scene cuts to the crowd. Elaine is sitting in the front with her disguise, and a guy behind her taps on her shoulder)<br>
							<br>
							
						WILTON: Elaine? It's me-- Wilton Marshall. Remember? Camp Tioga-- 1978? Remember?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oh, right.<br>
							<br>
							
						WILTON: Wow! You know you haven't changed a bit.<br>
							<br>
							
						(scene cuts to Michael, backstage, still walking around nervously. He sees Jerry andruns to him)<br>
							<br>
							
						MICHAEL: I can't remember my lines!!!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Just relax, you'll be fine.<br>
							<br>
							
						MICHAEL: I can't relax. I don't know what line! I don't know any of 'em!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You're just like George. George'd do the same thing. You're just like him. It's amazing!<br>
							<br>
							
						MICHAEL: Help me Jerry! Help me!<br>
							<br>
							
						(scene cuts to the producers in the crowd)<br>
							<br>
							
						RITA: (to Stu) Where is Russell?<br>
							<br>
							
						STU: You know I don't know. I thought he was coming. I assumed he wouldn't miss it.<br>
							<br>
							
						JAY: He hasn't been well.<br>
							<br>
							
						STU: (to Rita) Can I tell you something in confidence? I think it's a woman.<br>
							<br>
							
						RITA: How pathetic.<br>
							<br>
							
						(scene cuts to George on the same phone as Russell earlier)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: This is George Costanza, I'm calling for my test results. Negative? Oh, my God. WHY! WHY! WHY? What? What? Negative is good? Oh, yes of course! How stupid of me. Thank you. Thank you very much. (he hangs up)<br>
							<br>
							
						(scene cuts to the crowd and we see Joe Devola is there)<br>
							<br>
							
						(scene cuts to Kramer entering his apartment with the dreaded apparatus)<br>
							<br>
							
						(scene cuts to George, happy, eating and double-dipping chips. Tom is staring at him, George notices him, and aborts a double-dip)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (he walks casually to Tom, and taps his arm) Listen. I know we've had our problems in the past, but we got a show to do tonight. Time to pull together as a team. Life's too short. I say, let's let bygones be bygones. If you took the raisins, if you didn't take the raisins-- They weren't even my raisins. I was just curious because it seems like a strange to do to walk into a room, audition, and to walk out with a box of raisins. Anyway, whatever. If you ever want to tell me about it, the door to my office is always opened. In the event that I get an office. You'll come in, we'll talk about the raisins. We'll have a nice laugh.<br>
							<br>
							
						TOM: How would you like it if I just pulled your heart out of your chest right now, and shoved it down your throat?<br>
							<br>
							
						(scene cuts to the presentor, Pat Hazell, talking to the crowd)<br>
							<br>
							
						PAT HAZELL: Are you ready to meet our cast? (crowd applause) All right.<br>
							<br>
							
						(scene cuts to Kramer holding and staring at the dreaded apparatus, then closing his bathroom's door.)<br>
							<br>
							
						(scene cuts to Jerry, holding a microphone and talking to the crowd)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Good evening, folks. How you doing? (small reaction from the crowd) Well, you sound like a great crowd. We have a show we're gonna put on for you tonight. It's a new TV show. It's what they call a pilot. And we hope it becomes a series. It's called 'Jerry', and I'm playing Jerry--<br>
							<br>
							
						JOE DEVOLA: (getting up then shouting) SIC SEMPER TYRANNIS! (he jumps over a balcony and on the stage. The crowd is yelling)<br>
							<br>
							
						(scene ends)<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[setting: Jerry's]<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Sic semper tyrannis? What is that, Latin?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yeah, it's what John Wilkes Booth yelled out when he shot Lincoln.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Really? What does it mean?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: It means: &quot;Death to tyrants&quot;.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I can see that.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Elaine enters)<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: See, now this is exciting! This is exciting! Did I miss anything already?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: No, it starts in five minutes. You were there at the taping, what's the big deal?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Nah, now it's on TV. It's different. I told everybody I know to watch it.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Yeah, me too.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hey, what about Russell? Did you hear from him?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: No.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Strange. Even not showing up at the taping...<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer enters, singing and dancing)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Hey, pistol-packin mama, you swing that gal around, Allemande left with the old gray hag, around and around you go. Yee-ha!!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Well, well, well.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Congratulations.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Well, thank you.<br>

						(Elaine finds something under the couch cushions)<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Hey, what's this? Look. A wallet.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: A wallet? Let me see that.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Here.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Ah, man! It's my father's wallet! The one he thought they stole at the doctor's office that time.<br>

						===[TV]===<br>
							<br>
							
						(Jerry's doing his stand-up routine at a comedy club. There's the music theme and we don't hear what he is saying, but the closed captions put that:<br>
							<br>
							
						&quot;I get into a car accident. The guy that hit me doesn't have any insurance. So the judge sentences him to be my butler. Sounds like a sitcom, doesn't it?&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						We see the title 'Jerry', then, sitting at the comedy club, we see:<br>
							<br>
							
						Micheal, Sandi, and Tom, and finally Jerry, and the four of them make a toast while it's written: &quot;Created by Jerry Seinfeld and George Costanza&quot;.<br>

						MICHAEL: What do you need new sneakers for?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I like sneakers.<br>
							<br>
							
						MICHAEL: How do you make a decision which one to wear? I'd go crazy if I have to decide which sneakers to wear every day.<br>

							<br>
							
						JERRY: I'm not sending him to your house.<br>
							<br>
							
						TOM: Why not?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Because the judge decreed he'd become my butler, not my friend's butler.<br>
							<br>

						JERRY: You know I think when you name a baby Jeeves, you've pretty much mapped out his future, wouldn't you say? Not much chance is gonna be a hitman I think after that. (with a British accent) &quot;Terribly sorry Sir, but I'm going to have to whack you&quot;.<br>
