								<p><font size="-2">JERRY: Well, did you go down to the Kenny Rogers and complain?</font></p>
								<p><font size="-2">KRAMER: Ah, they gave me the heave ho. You know, I don't think that Kenny Rogers has any idea what's going on down there.</font></p>
								<p><font size="-2">(Kramer takes a pitcher of red liquid from the fridge and pours it on his cereal.)</font></p>

								<p><font size="-2">JERRY: ..living together after a while we... we might start to get on each others nerves a little.</font></p>
								<p><font size="-2">(Squeezes juice from rag into pitcher and puts it back in the fridge)</font></p>
								<p><font size="-2">KRAMER: Alright listen to me, I got a great idea. Now, you're a heavy sleeper, right? Why don't we just switch apartments?</font></p>
								<p><font size="-2">JERRY: Or I could sleep in the park? You could knock these walls down, make it an eight room luxury suite.</font></p>
								<p><font size="-2">KRAMER: Jerry these are load bearing walls, they're not gonna come down!</font></p>
								<p><font size="-2">JERRY: Yea, that's no good.</font></p>

										Nutria<br>
										Nutria, Myocastor coypus, are large semi-aquatic rodents indigenous to South America. The Original range included Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, paraguay and Uruguay.  In the 1930&rsquo;s nutria were imported into Louisiana for the fur farming industry and were released, either intentionally or accidentally into Louisiana coastal marshes. Nutria are herbivores and feed particularly on wetland plants. Nutria have caused extensive damage to Louisiana coastal wetlands due to their feeding activity.</font></p>
								<p><font size="-2">http://www.nationaltrappers.com/nutria.html<br>
										This member of the rodent family is native to South America, and it was introduced both accidentally and purposely in the waterways in several American states.&nbsp; The species has proved to be overly destructive of habitat in some areas, creating problems for muskrats and waterfowl.&nbsp; This species can tolerate winters in temperate areas only.&nbsp; An important fur bearer in Louisiana and Texas coastal area, nutria are viewed as detrimental in most other areas.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
