						[Monks]<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Oh, boy I was up to four in the morning watching the Omen trilogy.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: That's good stuff.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I can't to myself. I'm exhausted.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Can you grab a nap at work.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Not with that big glass window looking out into the hall. I'd love a good nap. That's the only thing getting me out of bed in the morning. I'll see ya'.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Bye.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: So what are you doing now?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I'm going to take a little stroll through the park.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: With a gentleman caller?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Yes, his name is Hal.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: The walking date is a good date. You don't have to look right at the other -person.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: It's the next best thing to being alone.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer enters - wet head)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Shower?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: No, pool. I just swam 200 laps.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: You are kidding.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Look at hose babies [hands]. They're prunes. I saw Conrad going up to oyur place.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oh, yeah, that's right. Those new kitchen cabinets. How is that coming?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: A little slow. I've got to hold this guy's hand on every little decision.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Hey, Kramer, listen, you've seen the Omen right?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: What exactly was that kid?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Who, Damien? Nothing, just a mischievous, rambunctious kid.<br>
							<br>
							
						&nbsp;<br>
							<br>
							
						[Yankee Stadium]<br>
							<br>
							
						WILHELM: Oh, George, have you seen the American league directory? It is a big green book. Oh, thanks kiddo.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Central park]<br>
							<br>
							
						HAL:<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Well I don't care. It was delicious.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Wanna sit down?<br>
							<br>
							
						HAL: Oh, I don't sit on park benches. They're very bad for the back.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Really?<br>
							<br>
							
						HAL: I threw my back out about 15 years ago. Ever since I have been very careful. I only buy furniture in the ergonomics store.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oh those places have the stupidest names. Like, uh, &quot;Back in &quot;, or &quot;Good Vertibrations&quot;.<br>
							<br>
							
						HAL: Not this one. It's called the &quot;Lumbar Yard&quot;.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Jerry's Apartment]<br>
							<br>
							
						CONRAD: Oh, Jerry are you okay with this hinge?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yeah.<br>
							<br>
							
						CONRAD: I can get you any kind you want, you know. Four holes, three holes, two holes, bronze, no hinge at all.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You know, why don't we just go with the one in your hand?<br>
							<br>
							
						CONRAD: Oh, these are different.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Drop one. . . . left!<br>
							<br>
							
						(George enters)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Jerry, look at my eyes.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: A little less beady today.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Because I'm REFRESHED. I finally found a way to sleep in my office. Under the desk. I lie on my back. I tuck in the chair. I'm invisible.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Sounds like a really cool fort.<br>
							<br>
							
						CONRAD: Jerry, do you want a flat edge on this molding or do you want me to bevel it?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I'll tell you what I would like you to do with it.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Conrad, is it?<br>
							<br>
							
						CONRAD: Conrad, Connie, or Con, whatever you prefer.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Uh, let me ask you a question. Could you, uh, expand the space underneath a desk to give it a little more headroom?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: He's kind of tied up here.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: It'll have to be a night job anyway. You don't normally work after dinner, do you?<br>
							<br>
							
						CONRAD: There is no normal, whatever jerry wants. He wants me here late, I'm here late, he wants me here early, I'm here early, he . . .<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Why don't you just work on George's project for a while?<br>
							<br>
							
						CONRAD: Whatever you want.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Next day - on the telephone)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: So how was Wednesday's walk in the park with Hal.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Uh, it was okay,. He's coming over later to watch a movie. Hey listen, what's better for your back? Couch cushions or a folding chair?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I don't know.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Uh, maybe we'll just stand and watch the tv. [knock knock]. I gotta go someone's at my door. Yeah!<br>
							<br>
							
						DELIVERY GUY: Delivery. Elaine Benes?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Yeah.<br>
							<br>
							
						DELIVERY GUY: We're from the Lumbar Yard, we got your mattress.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Mattress, I didn't order a mattress. Who sent this? Hal Kitzmiller?<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Yankee Stadium]<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Do you think it might be possible to add a little shelf like, uh, for an alarm clock?<br>
							<br>
							
						CONRAD: You mean like that big?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Like this.<br>
							<br>
							
						CONRAD: Yeah, I can do that.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Thanks. You know this could sound crazy but, what do you think about adding a drawer for - like a blanket?<br>
							<br>
							
						CONRAD: Blanket or quilt?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Blanket.<br>
							<br>
							
						CONRAD: That thick?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Maybe like this.<br>
							<br>
							
						CONRAD: Like that?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Yeah, like that.<br>
							<br>
							
						CONRAD: If that is what you want.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: That is what I want.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Later)<br>
							<br>
							
						CONRAD: Hey George, you want this cup holder mounted on the left, or the right, or the middle, . . .<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Whatever!!. . . . Oh oh oh this is unbelievable. This is better than my bed at home.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Its been a long night. You go home and get some sleep.<br>
							<br>
							
						CONRAD: If that's what you want.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: That's what I want.<br>
							<br>
							
						WILHELM: Morning George.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Good morning Mr. Wilhelm.<br>
							<br>
							
						(George escapes under his desk)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: got problems Jerry.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What happened?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Well I had been swimming for three hours and I was in a real grove so I decided to keep going. But at ten they start the aquasonics Thirty-five geriatrics throwing elbows. It was like I was swimming through a flabby armed spanking machine.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: How long did that last?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: A half hour then diving class started. Well&#133; that got a little messy. I gotta find a new place to swim 'cause that pooll can't hold me, Jerry.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Elaine enters)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: How was the movie?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I cancelled. Hal sent a mattress to my apartment. The nerve of that guy.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Why?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: He's got a back problem.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: So you think he was expecting a roll in the supportive hay.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: After one date!<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: What's that guy's last name again?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Kitzmiller.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Oh, that's right.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: So what are you going to do with the mattress?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I don't know. Chuck it?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Oh, no no no no I'll take it. Why don't you come over. Let's see if it will fit in my bedroom.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oh, all right.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: My old one sprung a leak.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: You have a water bed?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Sand! It's like sleeping on the beach.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Conrad enters)<br>
							<br>
							
						CONRAD: Hi, Jerry I'm sorry I'm late. George and I have been up working all night long. I can make up the time in any number of ways.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: How about this? . . . Finish this thing up today!<br>
							<br>
							
						CONRAD: Couple of questions for you.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: No. No more questions. Just figure it out for yourself and get it done.<br>
							<br>
							
						CONRAD: All right Jerry. But I can figure it out myself any way you want.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Just . . . do it.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Jerry exits)<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[George's office]<br>
							<br>
							
						STEINBRENNER: Costanza? Where's Costanza? . . . Excus&eacute; mois? Have you seen Costanza?<br>
							<br>
							
						SECRETARY: I've seen him around.<br>
							<br>
							
						STEINBRENNER: Um, I'm stuck on this song yesterday. I can't seem to get it out of my head. I don't know the name of that. &quot;She's a heart breaker, love taker . . ..Oh. Oh&quot; . . .very catchy. You know what? I can't stay awake for that guy. What is this? People? Um, the most beautiful people people. Ally Selica, Nothing wrong with that uh?<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Monks]<br>
							<br>
							
						HAL: Elaine, your taking this totally the wrong way. That's not what Ii intended.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Well, what did you intend, Hal?<br>
							<br>
							
						HAL: I just wanted you to have the comfort and report you deserve. That's why I had the mattress custom designed for you.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Custom designed?<br>
							<br>
							
						HAL: They adjust the foam density and spring tension to your body type. I estimated your height and weight. Five eight, about 110 pounds?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Uh, that is the nicest thing anyone has ever done for me.<br>
							<br>
							
						HAL: So you do like the mattress?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oh, I love it. I'm glad . . . I kept it.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[East River]<br>
							<br>
							
						FATHER: Over there, that's Brooklyn . That's where Spike Lee lives.<br>
							<br>
							
						SON: Hey, there's a man swimming in the water.<br>
							<br>
							
						FATHER: Naw, that's probably just a dead body son. You see when the mob kills someone they through the body in the river.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Jerry's hall]<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Jer.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hi.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Well my swimming pool problems are solved. I just found myself miles and miles of open lanes.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What is that smell?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: That's East River.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You're swimming in the East River? The most heavily trafficked overly contaminated waterway on the eastern seaboard?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Technically Norfok has more gross tonnage.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: How could you swim in that water?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: I saw a couple of other guys out there.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Swimming?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Floating, they weren't moving much. But they were out there.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Jerry's apartment]<br>

							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oh, this is a good mattress. Sniff, sniff, Ugh!<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>

							<br>
							
						STEINBRENNER: What is with this guy? I've been waiting three and a half hours. Should I go? No way Jack! ??? at the registrar again, I'll tell you that.<br>
							<br>
							
						SeConrad: Mr. Steinbrenner?<br>
							<br>
							
						STEINBRENNER: That's what they call me.<br>
							<br>
							
						SeConrad: Your grandchildren are here to see you.<br>

						STEINBRENNER: Oh, well, send them in. Send the little tykes in. &#133; little people .. pony express &#133; wow,<br>

						GEORGE: Jerry, I'm trapped under my desk. Steinbrenner is in the room. You got to help[ me.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Who is this?<br>

							<br>
							
						JERRY: Why don't you just have him paged?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Can't you think of something. Call in a bomb threat.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: A bomb threat? Why would I call in a bomb threat?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Just CALL!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I should have some reason.<br>
							<br>
							
						STEINBRENNER: Hey you kids know tunes; see if this song rinSTEINBRENNER a bell, &quot;Heartbreaker , . . . &quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						SeConrad: Mr. Steinbrenner we just received a call. There's a bomb in the building.<br>
							<br>
							
						STEINBRENNER: A bomb in the building, oh, m'god. Quick, everyone under the desk.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Steinbrenner's office]<br>
							<br>
							
						STEINBRENNER: Boy can you think of what went through my mind when I saw there wasn't going to be enough room under that desk for me and my babies.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I'm sorry sir.<br>
							<br>
							
						STEINBRENNER: You know what I think? I think you knew about that bomb ahead of time.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: What?<br>
							<br>
							
						STEINBRENNER: ???? about that bomb. You climbed under that desk because you have ESP. George, what's on my mind? . . . Meatballs! Huh? Unbelievable. Anyway this terrorist had a specific demand. Not more cheap adjustable hats on hat day. He wants fitted hats just like the players wear.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Jerry's new renovated apartment]<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Jerry, Jerry.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yeah.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: What the hell is this? Where are you?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Over here. You can see right through here.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: What is this. It's like you're selling movie tickets back here.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: It's kind of cozy.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Hey, you're not going to believe what Kramer did to my mattress. . . . I can't talk to you like this. So Kramer completely funked up my mattress.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Does it smell like the East River?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: How did you know?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Because Kramer has been swimming laps between the Queensborough bridge and the Brooklyn bridge.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oh, GREAT!<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer enters)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Oh man, I'm on the wrong floor again.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Hey, thanks for ruining my mattress. It reeks.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Hey, you know what I think it is? I think it's that East River. I think it might be polluted.<br>
							<br>
							
						(George enters)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Well, you really did it to me this time, Seinfeld. . . . What the hell happened here?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Hi.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Hi. Look at how obtrusive this is.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: It is obtrusive, isn't it?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: It is very obtrusive.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I don't think it's that bad.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: You can't get a stool in here.<br>
							<br>
