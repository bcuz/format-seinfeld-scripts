						[Opening Monologue]<br>
							
						To me, going to the health club, you see all these people and they're working out, and they're training and they're getting in shape but the strange thing is nobody is really getting in shape for anything. The only reason that you're getting in shape is that so you can get through the workout. So we're working out, so that we'll be in shape, for when we have to do our exercise. This is the whole thing. The other thing I don't get about it, is why we're so careful about locking up our dirty towels and smelly jock-straps. What exactly is the black market on these disgusting gym clothes? I give my car to any valet guy in front of a restaraunt because he has a short red jacket, yeah he must be the valet guy, I don't even think about it but my stinking, putrified gym clothes, I got one of these locks you could put a bullet through it and it won't open. That stuff is safe.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Gym Locker Room]<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Wide open, I was wide open underneath! I had three inches on that guy. You two were hogging the ball.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Me? It wasn't me I never even saw the ball. All you do is dribble.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I have to dribble, if I give it to you, you just shoot. You're a chucker.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Oh I'm a chucker.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: That's right, everytime you get the ball you shoot.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I can't believe you called me a chucker. No way I'm a chucker, I do not chuck, never chucked, never have chucked, never will chuck, no chuck!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You chuck.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEROGE: Kramer am I a chucker?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: You're a chucker.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: All these years I've been chuckin' and you've never told me?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Well it's not an easy thing to bring up.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Hey you know this is the first time we've ever seen each other naked.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Believe me I didn't see anything.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Oh, you didn't sneak a peak?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: No, did you?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Yeah, I snuck a peak.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Why?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Why not? hey what about you George?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: yeah, I ... I snuck a peak. ... But it was so fast I didn't see anything. It was just a blur.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I made a conscious effort not to look. There's certain information I just don't want to have.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Uh, I gotta go meet Newman. All right. I'll see you later.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: All right<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Have a good one.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: All right<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: See ya.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer exits)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: look at this guy. Does he have to stretch in here?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You know who that is? That's<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Keith Hernandez? The baseball player?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yeah, that's him.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Are you sure?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Positive.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Wow, Keith Hernandez. He's such a great player.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yeah, he's a real smart guy too. He's a Civil War buff.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I'd love to be a Civil War buff. ... What do you have to do to be a buff<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: So Biff wants to be a buff? ... Well sleeping less than 18 hours a day would be a start.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: ho ho ho ho. You know I only got two weeks left of unemployment. I got to prove I've been looking for a job to get an extension<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hey, should we say something to him?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Oh, yeah I'm sure he loves to hear from fans in the locker room.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: well he could say hello to me. I wouldn't mind.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: He's Keith Hernandez. You're Jerry Seinfeld.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: So?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: What are you comparing yourself to Keith Hernandez. The guys a baseball player Jerry, Baseball!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I know what he is. I recognized him. You didn't even notice him.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: What, ... you are making some wisecracks in a night club... wo wo wo. The guy was in game SIX two runs down two outs facing elimination.<br>
							<br>
							
						KEITH: Excuse me. I don't want to disturb you, I'm Keith Hernandez and I just want to tell you what a big fan I am. I love your comedy.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Really?<br>
							<br>
							
						KEITH: I've always wanted to do what you do.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What I do? You are one of my favorite ball players of all time<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Mine too.<br>
							<br>
							
						KEITH: I love that bit about Jimmy Olson<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Thank you.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: You know Keith, what I've always wondered, with all these ball clubs flying around all season don't you think there would be a plane crash? ...<br>
							<br>
							
						KEITH: (to Jerry) Do you perform anywhere in new York right now?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I'm performing in this club on the east Side. You should come in.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: But if you think about it...26 teams, 162 games a season, you'd think eventually an entire team would get wiped out.<br>
							<br>
							
						KEITH: You know, I live on the East Side.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I'll tell you what, I'll give you my number and uh, just give me a call, tell me whenever you want to go.<br>
							<br>
							
						KEITH: or maybe just to get together for a cup of coffee<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Oh. that would be great.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Uh, it's only a matter of time.<br>
							<br>
							
						KEITH: Who's this chucker?<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Monks]<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: It's been three days and he hasn't called.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Well maybe you should call him.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I can't ... I can't<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Why not?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I don't know. I just feel he should call me.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: What's the difference?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You don't understand, Elaine. I don't want to be overanxious. If he wants to see me he has my number, he should call.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Yech, look at this ashtray. I hate cigarettes.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I can't stand these guys. You give your number to them and then they don't call. Why do they do that?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I'm sorry honey.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I mean, I thought he liked me. I really thought he liked me. we were getting along. He came over to me I didn't go over to him.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: No,<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Why did he come over to me if he didn't want to see me?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I know.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What did he come over to me if he didn't want to see me? I mean here I meet this guy this great guy, a baseball player, best guy I ever met in my life. .. Well that's it. I'm never giving my number out to another guy again.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Sometimes I've given my number out to guys and it takes them a month to call.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hu, good, good,... well if he's calling in a month he's got a prayer!<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: You know maybe he's been busy. Maybe he's been out of town?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Oh, they don't have phones out of town? Why do(?) people say they're too busy. Too busy. Pick up a phone!! It takes two minutes. How can you be too busy?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Why don't you just go ahead and call him?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I can't call here, it's a coffee shop. I mean what am I going to say to him?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Just ask him if he wants a to get together.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: For what dinner?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Dinner's good.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Don't you think that's coming on a little too strong? .. Isn't that like a turn off?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Jerry, He's A GUY!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: ... this is all .. very confusing.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Middle Monologue]<br>

						When you're in your thirties it's very hard to make a new friend. Whatever the group is that you've got now that's who you're going with. you're not interviewing, you're not looking at any new people, you're not interested in seeing any applications. They don't know the places. They don't know the food. They don't know the activities, If I meet a guy in a club on the gym or someplace I'm sure you're a very nice person you seem to have a lot of potential, but we're just not hiring right now. Of course when you're a kid, you can be friends with anybody. Remember when you were a little kid what were the qualifications? If someone's in front of my house NOW, That's my friend, they're my friend. That's it. Are you a grown up.? No. Great! Come on in. Jump up and down on my bed. And if you have anything in common at all, You like Cherry Soda? I like Cherry Soda! We'll be best friends!<br>

							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Our day was ruined. There was a lot of people, you know, they were waiting by the player's parking lot. Now we're coming down the ramp ... [cut to film of the day - like the Zabruter film - with the Umbrella man and everything - Oh so brilliant parody!!!] ... Newman was in front of me. Keith was coming toward us, as he passes Newman turns and says, &quot; Nice game pretty boy.&quot;. Keith continued past us up the ramp.<br>
							<br>
							
						NEWMAN: A second later, something happened that changed us in a deep and profound way front that day forward.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: What was it?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: He spit on us.... and I screamed out, &quot;I'm hit!&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						NEWMAN: Then I turned and the spit ricochet of him and it hit me.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Wow! What a story.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Unfortunately the immutable laws of physics contradict the whole premise of your account. Allow me to reconstruct this if I may for Miss Benes as I've heard this story a number of times.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Newman, Kramer, if you'll indulge me. According to your story Keith passes you and starts walking up the ramp then you say you were struck on the right temple. The spit then proceeds to ricochet off the temple striking Newman between the third and forth rib. The spit then cam off the rib turned and hit Newman in the right wrist causing him to drop his baseball cap. The spit then splashed off the wrist, Pauses In mid air mind you- makes a left turn and lands on Newman's left thigh. That is one magic luggie.<br>
							<br>
							
						[THE BRILLIANCE OF THIS SCENE IS THAT IT IS AN EXACT PARODY OF KEVIN COSTNER'S COURTROOM; SCENE IN<br>
							
						THE FILM JFK - AND WAYNE KNIGHT PLAYED THE SAME POSITION IN BOTH!!!]<br>
							<br>
							
						NEWMAN: Well that's the way it happened.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What happened to your head when you got hit?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Well. uh, well my head went back and to the left<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Again<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Back and to the left<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Back and to the left Back and to the left<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: So, what are you saying?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I am saying that the spit could not have come from behind ... that there had to have been a second spitter behind the bushes on the gravelly road. If the spitter was behind you as you claimed that would have caused your head to pitch forward.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: So the spit could have only come from the front and to the right.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: But that is not what they would have you believe.<br>
							<br>
							
						NEWMAN: I'm leavin'. Jerry's a nut. (Exits)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Wait, wait, (Exits)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: The sad thing is we may never know the real truth.<br>
							<br>
							
						(George runs in)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (Frantically) Did anybody call here asking for Vandelay industries?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: No. What happened to you?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Now, listen closely. I was at the unemployment office and I told them that I was very close to getting a job with Vandelay Industries and I gave them your phone number. So, when now when the phone rings you've got to answer &quot;Vandelay Industries&quot;.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I'm Vandelay Industries?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Right.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: And what is that?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: You're in latex<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Latex? And what do I do with latex?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Ya manufacture it.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Here in this little apartment?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: And what do I say about you?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: You're considering hiring me for your latex salesman.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I'm going to hire you as my latex salesman?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Right.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I don't think so. Why would I do that?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Because I asked you to.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: If you think I'm looking for someone to just sit at a desk pushing papers around, you can forget it. I have enough headaches just trying to manufacture the stuff.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Buzzer)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yeah.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: It's Keith.<br>

							<br>
							
						JERRY: That's what I've been trying to figure out the past five years.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: What the hell are you two talking about? (All exit)<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Keith's car]<br>

							<br>
							
						GEORGE: So, uh, you gonna see him again?<br>
