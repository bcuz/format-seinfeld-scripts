						[Elaine's bedroom - phone rings]<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Hello<br>
							<br>
							
						JAMES: This is your wake up service. It's 7:15<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oh, god. OH, I could use a few more hours sleep.<br>
							<br>
							
						JAMES: Hot date last night?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I wish.<br>
							<br>
							
						JAMES: A woman with a sexy voice like yours its hard to believe your waking up alone.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Really? Thank you., wake up service . . . person.<br>
							<br>
							
						JAMES: Call me James.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oh, all right, James. He he he<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Monks]<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Your wake up guy asked you out?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Yeah, I've never seen him but I feel like we have this weirdly intimate relationship. I mean, I'm lying in bed, I'm wearing my nightie,<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I don't know. Blind date?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: What? You're going to go out with my cousin Holly. You've never met her.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yeah, but I've seen pictures of her.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: At least I've spoken to my guy. You're going out on a deaf date.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I think I'd rather go out on a deaf date than a blind date. The question is whether you'd rather date the blind or the deaf.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Ah, . . .<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Now you're off on a topic.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You know, I think, I would rather date the deaf.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Uh hu.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Because I think the blind would probably be a little messier around the house. And lets face it they're not going to get all the crumbs. I'd possibly be walking around with a sponge.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: You see I disagree. I'd rather be dating the blind. You know you could let the house go. You could let yourself go. A good looking blind woman doesn't even know you're not good enough for her.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I think she'd figure it out.<br>
							<br>
							
						(waitress places plates on the table)<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: What? What is this?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Veggie sandwich and a grapefruit.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Veggie sandwich and a grapefruit? What are you turning into?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: A healthy person.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: ( rubbing his eye) Ow, Ow you squirted me.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Oh, sorry<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Boy, it stings.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Yankee Stadium]<br>
							<br>
							
						WILHELM: George, have you seen Morgan?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: No.<br>
							<br>
							
						WILHELM: He's been coming in late all week. Is there something wrong?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: No, not that I know of. (winks)<br>
							<br>
							
						WILHELM: Really? Make sure he signs this. Oh, look George, if there's a problem with Morgan you can tell me.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Morgan? No. He's doing a great job. (winks)<br>
							<br>
							
						WILHELM: I understand.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Jerry's apartment]<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I still can't believe, you're going out on a blind date.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I'm not worried. It sounds like he's really good looking.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You're going by sound? What are we? Whales?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I think I can tell.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Elaine, what percentage of people would you say are good looking?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Twenty-five percent.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Twenty-five percent, you say? No way! It's like 4 to 6 percent. It's a twenty to one shot.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: You're way off.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Way off? Have you been to the motor vehicle bureau? It's like a leper colony down there.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: So what you are saying is that 90 to 95 percent of the population is undateable?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: UNDATEABLE!<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Then how are all these people getting together?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Alcohol.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: (to George who is winking) What is your problem?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: No problem here.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: You keep winking at me. That's really obnoxious.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I had no idea.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Right there. Right there. You just did it again.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Wait a minute. Wait a minute. It's from that grapefruit that Jerry squirted at me.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: You're eye still hurts?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Yeah, yeah. You must have squirted a piece of pulp in it too.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Pulp couldn't make it across the table.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Pulp can move, Baby! Why didn't you eat a real breakfast?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hey, I eat healthy. If I have to take out an eye, that's the breaks.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Wait a minute. I must have been winking down at the office. That's why Mr. Wilhelm was acting so mysteriouso.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: What did he think, you were flirtin' with him?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Hu, oh. No he thought I was hiding something from him about Morgan.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer enters)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Hi guys.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hi,<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Hello Archie, Veronica, Mr. Weatherbee. . . . Is this Don Matingly's signature?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Yeah.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: And Buck Showalter's?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: It's an inter-office envelope. It get passed around all over the office.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Um, can I show this to my buddy Stubbs . He runs a sports memorabilia store. He pays top dollar for pro autographs.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Yeah, like I'm going to risk my job with the New York Yankees to make a few extra bucks. (winks)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: No, of course not. (winks back)<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Sports Memorabilia Shop]<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: You know, you see Don Matingly signed this envelope then he sent it to room 318, where it was received and signed for by manager Buck Showalter.<br>
							<br>
							
						STEINBRENNER: I don't know. An envelope doesn't really cut it.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Why?<br>
							<br>
							
						STEINBRENNER: What is this? A birthday card. Ha ha . . . signed by the ENTIRE Yankee organization! . . . This could be worth something.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Yankee Stadium]<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Is that the lovely Mrs. Morgan?<br>
							<br>
							
						MORGAN: Hello.<br>
							<br>
							
						MORGAN: Oh, by the way, have you got that birthday card?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Birthday card?<br>
							<br>
							
						MORGAN: Mr. Steinbrenner's birthday card. Wilhem said you had it for me to sign.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Oh ah, I uh, will have that for you by after lunch.<br>
							<br>
							
						MORGAN: Fine. I'll be back after my massage.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Of course. Your massage. (winks) Enjoy your massage. (winks)<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Monk's - Elaine sitting alone]<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Hello.<br>
							<br>
							
						James: Elaine?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: James! Ah, ha, Hello! Phew!<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Old Homestead Steak House]<br>
							<br>
							
						HOLLY: I can't believe you've never taken anybody here before.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Well, I'm not really that much of a meat eater.<br>
							<br>
							
						HOLLY: . . . You don't eat meat? Are you one of those. . .<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Well, no, I'm not one of those.<br>
							<br>
							
						HOLLY: When we were little girls Grandma Memma would take us to a matinee and then dinner here.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Grandma Memma?<br>
							<br>
							
						HOLLY: Elaine must have mentioned Grandma Memma.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: No, I think I would have remembered Memma.<br>
							<br>
							
						HOLLY: Oh well, that's typical. Elaine never liked Grandma Memma.<br>
							<br>
							
						WAITER: Ready?<br>
							<br>
							
						HOLLY: I'll have the porterhouse medium rare, baked potato with sour cream,<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What do you recommend besides the steak?<br>
							<br>
							
						WAITER: The lamb chops are good.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Anything lighter? How do you prepare the chicken?<br>
							<br>
							
						WAITER: It's a full bird. Stuffed with ham, topped with gorganzola.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You know what? I think I'll just have the salad.<br>
							<br>
							
						WAITER: . . . Thank you.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (mind's voice) Just a salad? Just a salad? Just a salad?<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Outside of Monk's - James unties his dogs]<br>
							<br>
							
						JAMES: Hey you, hey you.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oh, uh, ha, you've got dogs?<br>
							<br>
							
						JAMES: Yeah, you know, when you live alone, you're dogs are all you have. Do you like dogs?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: (mind's voice from - &#133; ) SHUT UP! YOU STUPID LITTLE MUT !<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Dogs. Oh I love dogs.<br>
							<br>
							
						JAMES: Boys, this is Elaine. . . . Sorry, they're usually very friendly. Hey!<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Yankee Stadium]<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Hey, Mr. Morgan how was your massage?<br>
							<br>
							
						MORGAN: I had to cancel it. For some reason my wife got it into her head that it was more than just a massage.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Really?<br>
							<br>
							
						MORGAN: Yeah, we had this big fight at lunch it looks like tonight I will be sleeping on the couch.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Hey, listen don't oversleep. You can't afford to be late again.<br>
							<br>
							
						MORGAN: I know. Somebody around here has been giving Wilhelm the impression that I have been slacking off.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Geez, Hey you know something, you should try my friend's wake up service. She swears by this thing.<br>
							<br>
							
						MORGAN: Costanza, you may be my only friend around here. By the way, you got that birthday card?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Ah, not yet.<br>
							<br>
							
						MORGAN: Just make sure Steinbrenner doesn't get it until I sign it.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Yes sir!<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Jerry's apartment]<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I just don't understand it as soon as I met these dogs they started growling at me.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Maybe his dogs heard about how you tried to kidnap that other dog. These muts like to gossip. So have you talked too Holly?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Huh huh.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Did she mention anything about our lunch?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Uh, kind of.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What do you mean, &quot;kind of.&quot;?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I mean, she thought it was kind of strange to just order a salad. . . . You know. . . . For a man.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What are you saying? . . . Salad! What was I thinking? Women don't respect salad eaters.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: You got that right.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: But you're going over there for dinner tonight, right?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Um uh.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What is she making?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I don't know. But I'm sure it had, . . . parents. Call her up. She won't mind if you come.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Oh, don't worry. I'll be there and I'll be packing an artery.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer's door - George knocks)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Ah, Mr. Weatherbee.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: You got the Yankee envelope?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Sure do.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: oh,<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Here you go.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Hey, he,<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: You'll be pleased to see what's inside.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: What is this?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: You're cut of the loot. Stubs gave me 200 dollars for the autographed birthday card that was inside.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Who told you to sell the card?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: You did.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: No I didn't!<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: No, not in so many words but I believe we had an understanding. (winks)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I was not winking you idiot. That was the grapefruit. It's like acid. I need that card back. It's Mr. Steinbrenner's. I was responsible.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Well Stubs has already sold it to some guy who's kid's in the hospital .<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Well get it back! It's very important. (winks)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Look, do you want me to get it back or not?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (holds eyes wide open) Get it back!<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Holly's apartment]<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Such a lovely table setting. Oh, wear did you get these napkins?<br>
							<br>
							
						HOLLY: They're grandma Memma's.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oh, I don't remember them.<br>
							<br>
							
						HOLLY: Oh, you wouldn't. She only used them on special occasions.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Special occassions? It wasn't special when my family visited?<br>
							<br>
							
						HOLLY: Everybody like mutton?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Um, mutton! Hope you didn't cut the fat off.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Hospital room]<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: That you Bobby?<br>
							<br>
							
						BOBBY: huh<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Well, I heard that you have a very uh, special birthday card .with all the Yankee autographs on it.<br>
							<br>
							
						BOBBY: Sure do. Mister.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Oh, that's it, yeah. Boy, Stubs sure went to town with this thing huh? Yeah, well, Bobby, uh, what if I told you a very important person at the New York Yankees needed this card back.<br>
							<br>
							
						BOBBY: Oh, no. I'd never part with this card for anything in the world.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Well, uh, Bobby, uh, who's your favorite Yankee.<br>
							<br>
							
						BOBBY: Paul O'Neill.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: All right. What if I tell Paul O'Neill to hit a home run tomorrow, just for you.<br>
							<br>
							
						BOBBY: Would he? Paul O'Neill would do that?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: For you he would.<br>
							<br>
							
						BOBBY: Would he hit two home runs?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Two? Sure kid, yeah. But then you gotta promise you'll do something for me.<br>
							<br>
							
						BOBBY: I know. Get out of this bed one day and walk again.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Yeah, that would be nice. But I really just need this card.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Holly's apartment]<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: What about this candelabra?<br>
							<br>
							
						HOLLY: Yeah, that was grandma Memma's also. She bought it on her trip to Europe in 1936. Jerry, I'm thrilled you like my mutton. I was afrais you only ate . . . salad.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hey, salad's got nothin' on this mutton.<br>
							<br>
							
						HOLLY: That is so funny. Did you just make that up?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I wish I could take credit for it. It's actually the line my butcher uses when we're chewing the fat. How about that beautiful desk over there? (hides meat in napkin in jacket)<br>
							<br>
							
						HOLLY: That was in Grandma's study.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: What did you do, ransack the place after she died?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: This is some FINE mutton.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I'm getting out of here. Can I borrow your jacket?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Uh, well, uh the thing is that . . . (Jerry grabs jacket back)<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: It's cold out, and I didn't bring my own. Jerry! God forbid I should borrow one from Holly. It might have belonged to grandma Memma. Thanks for mutton.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[On the street - dogs following Elaine]<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Down boy, nice doggy . I'm a nice person. Don't believe what you hear.<br>
							<br>

						[Holly's]<br>
							<br>
							
						HOLLY: Where are the napkins?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What?<br>
							<br>
							
						HOLLY: Grandma Memma's napkins. There's two missing. Elaine took them didn't she?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I don't know about that. Have you got any floss?<br>
							<br>
							
						HOLLY: You heard her. She coveted them. I bet she took them just to spite me. She's probably having a good laugh about it right now.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[On the street dogs chasing Elaine]<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Down doggy . oh oh a a a a a<br>

						[James' apartment]<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Elaine, what are you doing in this neighborhood?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Did you do with the dogs?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yeah, they're in the kitchen. . . . okay, quite! What's going on?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: These dogs were chasing me. And no cab would stop and I had to get off the street. Then I remembered that you lived here.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Why were dogs chasing you?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: They just don't like me. It's a long story. I can tell you one day but I can't tell you right now.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I would askk you to stay tonight but I only have the sofa bed and it's where I sleep.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: We'll have to sleep head to toe.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Head to toe?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Head to toe.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[The next morning at James']<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Hey, wake up. It's 8:30 you were supposed to walk me up at 7:15.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I'm sorry I didn't get any sleep you kept kicking me in the face.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: You're a wake up guy. Don't you have calls to make?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I'll make them later. Uh.<br>

						[Yankee Stadium - George's office]<br>
							<br>
							
						WILHELM: Have you seen Morgan?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: He's not here?<br>
							<br>
							
						WILHELM: No, He's late.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: It's impossible. I got him a wake up service.<br>
							<br>
							
						WILHELM: Now, George, you don't have to cover for him any more. He's going to be gone soon and I'm going to recommend you for his job.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: . . . gone?<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Monk's]<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: It sounds like all the winking got you a promotion.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I don't want Morgan's job. He's got a lot of work to do. Hey, Elaine, your friend never woke up Mr. Morgan.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Nah, he was tired. He had some feet in his face. My cousin Holly is completely insane. She keeps calling and accusing me of stealing her napkins.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Napkins?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I mean, why? Why would I take her stupid napkins.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Because they were in the pockets of my jacket.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: They were?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yes. I was using them to spit out the mutton.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Spit it out? I had dogs chasing me for that mutton. I was almost mauled because of that mutton.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: What exactly is mutton?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I don't know and I didn't want to find out. So where is my jacket?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oh, I must have left it at Jame's<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You spent the night at James's? Did we?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Yeah but we reversed positions so there was no funny business.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Reversed positions?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Yeah, you know, head to toe.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: So what your genitals are still lined up.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: No, because I slept with my back to him.<br>

							<br>
							
						O'NEILL: Yeah.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Yeah, uh, look, you don't know me.<br>
							<br>
							
						O'NEILL: I can give you an autograph there, but my pen's kind of screwed up. You'd only like half a &quot;P&quot; or something.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: No, it's uh, not that see,. It's about a little boy in a hospital. I was wondering if you could do something to lift his spirits.<br>
							<br>
							
						O'NEILL: Sure, I could help you there.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Sure, well I promised you would hit him two home runs.<br>
							<br>
							
						O'NEILL: Say what?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: You know, Klick!. A couple of dingers.<br>
							<br>
							
						O'NEILL: You promised a kid in the hospital that I would hit two home runs?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Yeah, well, no good?<br>
							<br>
							
						O'NEILL: Yeah. That's no good. It's terrible. You don't hit home runs like that. It's hard to hit home runs. And where the heck did you get two from?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Two is better than one.<br>
							<br>
							
						O'NEILL: That, that's ridiculous. I'm not a home run hitter.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Well, Babe Ruth did it.<br>
							<br>
							
						O'NEILL: He did not.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Oh, do you say that Babe Ruth is a liar?<br>
							<br>
							
						O'NEILL: I'm not calling him a liar but he was not stupid enough to promise two.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Well, maybe I did overextend myself.<br>
							<br>
							
						O'NEILL: How the heck did you get in here anyway?<br>

							<br>
							
						KRAMER: It's hot in here. Hey, Bobby, can I have some of your juice?<br>
							<br>
							
						BOBBY: After Paul O'Neill hits his first home run.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Jerry's]<br>
							<br>
							
						HOLLY: (from buzzer) It's Holly.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yeah. Come on up.<br>
							<br>
							
						TV: And the two and one pitch to O'Neill. A towering shot back to deep right field and it's gone.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Hospital]<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Yeah.<br>
							<br>

							<br>
							
						HOLLY: I decided I was going to make you dinner.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I thought we were going out.<br>
							<br>
							
						HOLLY: Well, after you scarfed up my mutton I had the irresistible urge to make pork chops for you. I said hello to Franco for you.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Franco?<br>
							<br>
							
						HOLLY: Your butcher, down the street.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I bet he acted aloof like he didn't know me.<br>
							<br>
							
						HOLLY: A little.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: That is so Franco.<br>

						[Hospital]<br>
							<br>
							
						TV: Bottom of the eighth, score tied at one apiece. Two and one to Paul O'Neill.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: You know Bobby, it's very very hard to hit two home runs in one game. Even for Paul O'Neill.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: He can do it, Mr. Kramer. I know he can. He'll do it for me.<br>
							<br>
							
						TV: &quot;Klick! Long fly ball into deep left field over Bell's head . . . O'Neill's rounding second O'Neill going for third, O'Neill rounding . . .<br>

						TV: . . . third being waived in.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: GO! GO!!<br>
							<br>
							
						TV: . . . Martinez throws it over Alomar's head. O'Neill is safe at home. And the Yankees take the lead.<br>

							<br>
							
						BOBBY: Yeay!<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: All Right! Yeah, well, I guess I'll be on my way (grabs framed card)<br>
							<br>
							
						TV: That's being scored a triple for Paul O'Neill with a throwing error charged to Martinez.<br>
							<br>
							
						BOBBY: Hey, &#133;<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Huh?<br>
							<br>
							
						BOBBY: &#133; that's not a home run. (grabs frame)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Yeah, maybe not technically, but &#133;<br>
							<br>
							
						BOBBY: You said he'd hit two home runs.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Oh, come on. Bobby, Bobby! That's just as good!<br>
							<br>
							
						BOBBY: Well, you're not taking that card.<br>

						ELAINE: I didn't take your napkins.<br>
							<br>
							
						HOLLY: Then who did?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Ask Jerry.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: We could argue all night over who took the napkins. The point is in today's modern world it just doesn't seem relevant.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[George's office, Yankee Stadium]<br>
							<br>
							
						WILHELM: I still want to know what happened to that birthday card? Now, Morgan, did you ever sign it?<br>
							<br>
							
						MORGAN: No sir, George never gave it to me.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: No, that's right, I didn't. I take full responsibility for the card not being here. I, uh, . . .<br>

						KRAMER: (to George) Oh, by the way, tomorrow night, Paull O'Neill has to catch a fly ball in his hat.<br>
							<br>
							
						WILHELM: George, this is beautiful. Why didn't you tell me you were going to have it mounted like this?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: And you were probably just going to stick it in an envelope.<br>
							<br>
							
						WILHELM: Ha ha ha ha ha, George, keep up the good work.<br>
							<br>
							
						MORGAN: Ha ha, uh, well you screwed me again, Costanza. How am I supposed to sign the card now when it's already under glass?<br>

						HOLLY: You gave Memma's napkins to some dogs?!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hey, what happened to my jacket?<br>
							<br>
							
						JAMES: Oh, the dogs did that but it wasn't their fault, somebody stuffed some strange meat in the pocket.<br>
							<br>
							
						HOLLY: Was it mutton?<br>
							<br>
							
						JAMES: Could have been.<br>

							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Oh, no, not just me, the whole organization. Especially Mr. Morgan.<br>
							<br>
							
						STEINBRENNER: Morgan, Morgan, you know his name is conspicuously absent from this card. Almost like he went out of his way not to sign it.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Oh no, Morgan is a good man sir.<br>
							<br>
							
						STEINBRENNER: You can stop kowtowing to Morgan. Congratulations, you got his job.<br>
