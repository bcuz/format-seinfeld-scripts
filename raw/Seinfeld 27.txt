						[Opening monologue]<br>
							<br>
							
						So I was in the drug store the other day, trying to get a cold medication.&nbsp; You ever try and pick one of these out?&nbsp; It's not easy.&nbsp; It's a wall.&nbsp; It's an entire wall of cold medication, you stand there, you're going, &quot;Alright, alright, alright, okay, what the hell--&nbsp; This is quick acting, but this is long lasting.&nbsp; When do I need to feel good, now or later?&quot;&nbsp; It's a tough question. And they always show you the commercials on TV where they show you what's wrong with the guy, you know?&nbsp; They always show you, like, all the problems that he's having.&nbsp; First of all, the always show you the human body, which is usually this guy.&nbsp; No face, mouth open, this is how drug companies see the public.&nbsp; And he's always in, like, a certain pain, it's like red wavy lines are going through him or he's glowing, parts of him are on fire sometimes, lightning is attacking him. I never had a doctor say to me, &quot;Are you having any pain?&quot;&nbsp; &quot;Yes I am.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;Are you having any lightning with the pain?&quot;<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Jerry and George are in a drug store.]<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; How did you get fleas?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; Because my cousin's imbecile dog was rolling around outside and they got in his carpet.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; Maybe you can get yourself a little bowtie flea collar.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; That's not funny.&nbsp; So, are you coming to the party?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; I'd go, but Long Island, it's so far out, it smacks of desperation.&nbsp; The whole party, everyone's gonna be saying to me, &quot;You came all the way out from Manhattan for this?&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; You know Ava's gonna be there.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; Who?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; The nice one that works in my office.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; Nah.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; I'll drive.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; Oh, well, now you're talking.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; It's supposed to be a good party.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; What does that mean, good dip?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; No, there'll be girls there.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; There's girls everywhere.&nbsp; I go out of my apartment, there's girls in the elevator.&nbsp; They're in cafeterias, subways, so what?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; There's a hundred different things here.&nbsp; What's the difference between these two?&nbsp; (They each grab a box and check the ingredients)&nbsp; You got propylparabin?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; Got it.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; You got isobutane-30?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; I got isobutane-20.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; A-ha.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; You got&nbsp; sorbitant sesquioliate?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; Got it.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; I have aloe!<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; You got aloe?&nbsp; I love aloe.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; Where do they make yours?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; Jersey.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; White Plains.<br>
							<br>
							
						(George puts down the &quot;Jersey&quot; box and grabs the &quot;White Plains&quot; box from Jerry and they go to the check out counter.&nbsp; Two women are standing at the magazine rack in the background.)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; Girls.&nbsp; There's girls right here in the store.&nbsp; Look, look, there's one over there.&nbsp; Look, there's another one.&nbsp; Soon as I walk outside there'll be girls out there.&nbsp; What's the matter?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; I gave her a twenty, she only gave me change for a ten.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; Are you sure?&nbsp; Oh boy, here we go.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (to the cashier)&nbsp; Excuse me, I gave you a twenty dollar bill and you only actually gave me change for a ten.<br>
							<br>
							
						CASHIER:&nbsp; You gave me a ten.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; I'm positive I gave you a twenty.<br>
							<br>
							
						CASHIER:&nbsp; I know what you gave me.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; You owe me ten dollars.<br>
							<br>
							
						CASHIER:&nbsp; Will you please step aside?&nbsp; Next?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; Alright, let's just examine the situation for a second.&nbsp; Who, in this situation, would be more likely to make a mistake?&nbsp; Me, who had access to my wallet, knew exactly what was in there?&nbsp; Or you--<br>
							<br>
							
						CASHIER:&nbsp; You.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; No, no, no, see you're not really listening.<br>
							<br>
							
						SECURITY GUARD:&nbsp; What's the problem here?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; No problem.&nbsp; There's no problem.&nbsp; She just owes me ten dollars, that's all.<br>
							<br>
							
						CASHIER:&nbsp; He's claiming short.<br>
							<br>
							
						SECURITY GUARD:&nbsp; Alright, let's just take it outside.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; Oh, so you don't believe me either?<br>
							<br>
							
						SECURITY GUARD:&nbsp; Come on, let's go.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; You haven't won.&nbsp; You may think you've won, but you haven't won.&nbsp; Do you know why?&nbsp; It's not over.&nbsp; This is not over.&nbsp; I'm not forgetting what's happening here.&nbsp; You have my ten dollars.&nbsp; I will get it back.&nbsp; Alright, don't worry.&nbsp; It's not over.&nbsp; I'm going now.&nbsp; Good bye.&nbsp; I will be back.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door]<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE:&nbsp; Well don't stand here, let's walk in, blend in, blend in.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; No, let's survey first.&nbsp; Camp here.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (waving:&nbsp; Eva.<br>
							<br>
							
						(A beautiful woman starts walking over.)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; What could possess anyone to throw a party?&nbsp; I mean, to have a bunch of strangers treat your house like a hotel room.<br>
							<br>
							
						AVA:&nbsp; So, guess who just sold 129 West 81st.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; Oh no you didn't.&nbsp; Get out, when?<br>
							<br>
							
						AVA:&nbsp; Yesterday<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; I don't believe it.<br>
							<br>
							
						AVA:&nbsp; Ask Mark.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; Mark, is this true?<br>
							<br>
							
						(A man across the room nods.&nbsp; George and Ava walk towards him.)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; Yeah, this has got disaster written all over it.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE:&nbsp; How did I ever let you talk me into this, I must have been out of my mind.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; Now listen, let's keep an eye on each other tonight.&nbsp; In case one of us gets in a bad conversation, we should have a signal that you're in trouble so the other one can get us out of it.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE:&nbsp; How old are you?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; Thirty-six.&nbsp; What's the signal?&nbsp; Howbout this?&nbsp; Chicken wing?&nbsp; No, no, no, I got a better one.&nbsp; Head patting.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE:&nbsp; Whatever you want.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Fast forward a bit, Jerry is sitting on the couch with a stranger.)<br>
							<br>
							
						GUY:&nbsp; You came all the way out from Manhattan for this?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; Yeah, yeah I did.<br>
							<br>
							
						GUY:&nbsp; So what do you do?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (Patting his head:&nbsp; I'm a comedian.<br>
							<br>
							
						GUY:&nbsp; Are you?&nbsp; Lemme ask you something.&nbsp; Where do you get your material?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (still Patting)&nbsp; I hear a voice.<br>
							<br>
							
						GUY:&nbsp; What kind of voice?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; A man's voice, but he speaks in German so I have to get a translator.<br>
							<br>
							
						GUY:&nbsp; How come you keep tapping your head.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; It's a nervous tic.&nbsp; I'm on L-Dopa.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Cut to Elaine, engaged in a conversation with another guy and patting her head.)<br>
							<br>
							
						GUY:&nbsp; On the other hand, you take a guy like George Washington Carver.&nbsp; The man devoted his whole life to the peanut.&nbsp; Imagine having so much passion for something.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Cut back to Jerry and his 'guy'.)<br>
							<br>
							
						GUY:&nbsp; Ya know, people tell me I'm a funny guy.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Cut back to Elaine and her 'guy'.&nbsp; She's still tapping madly.)<br>
							<br>
							
						GUY:&nbsp; I've often wondered if he ever worked with the pecan.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE:&nbsp; Yeah, me too.<br>
							<br>
							
						GUY:&nbsp; Now is that considered a nut, because I know the cashew is a legume.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Cut to George, now talking with Jerry.)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; How's it going?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; Great, how about you?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; I can't believe what's happening here.&nbsp; She hasn't taken her hands off me all night.&nbsp; She was always friendly around the office, but that was it.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; How do you account for this?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; I don't know, maybe a safe fell on her head.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; Well, she obviously liked you all along.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; No, I would have picked up on it.&nbsp; I can always tell when a woman likes me, they always somehow let you know.&nbsp; With me, they could torture me, I wouldn't tell them.&nbsp; If anything I'd try to make them think I don't like them, then they think, &quot;Oh, look at this guy, he's not even looking at me, he must have something going for him.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; Anyway, I'm ready to go.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; Now?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; If not now, when?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; Gimme a half-hour.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; Okay, half-hour.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Cut to Elaine and the 'peanut guy'.&nbsp; By now, she's weary from tapping.)<br>
							<br>
							
						GUY:&nbsp; Peanut brittle, peanut butter, peanut oil...<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (interrupting)&nbsp; Can I talk to you for a second?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE:&nbsp; Oh, excuse me.&nbsp; (gets up to talk with Jerry)&nbsp; What have you been doing, I've been smacking myself senseless.&nbsp; People think I'm a mental patient.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; Hey, I was dying over there.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE:&nbsp; This guy's going off on the peanut.&nbsp; Now pay attention.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Fast forward a bit, a woman (Ellen) is talking to Jerry.)<br>
							<br>
							
						ELLEN:&nbsp; Yeah, I think I've seen you in a club.&nbsp; You talk about a lot of everyday things, right?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; Right.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELLEN:&nbsp; Yeah, I remember you.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Ellen turns her back and the camera pans out to Elaine, sitting on the couch near a pretentious woman.)<br>
							<br>
							
						WOMAN:&nbsp; I wonder what happened to my fianc&eacute;.&nbsp; I know he's here somewhere. Ellen?&nbsp; Have you seen my fianc&eacute;?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELLEN:&nbsp; He's upstairs.<br>
							<br>
							
						WOMAN:&nbsp; Are you going upstairs?&nbsp; Tell my fianc&eacute; I'm looking for him.&nbsp; I havelost my fianc&eacute;, the poor baby.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE:&nbsp; Maybe the dingo ate your baby.<br>
							<br>
							
						WOMAN:&nbsp; What?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE:&nbsp; The dingo ate your baby!<br>
							<br>
							
						(Cut to George and Jerry.)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; You ready?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; Listen, I have a tremendous favor to ask.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; I do favors.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; I think something's happening here.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; What?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; I think she wants me to take her home.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; Wow.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; What should I do?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; Go!&nbsp; What could you do?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; What about you and Elaine?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; We'll get a ride.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; Are you sure?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; We'll be fine, what did she say?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; She told me she wants-- (Pauses until a woman coming down the stairs passes)&nbsp; She told me she wants me to make love to her.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; What?&nbsp; She said that?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; Yeah.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; Get out of here.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; I swear.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; What did you say?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; I, I, I can't.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; What did you say?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; Please, it's--<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; What?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; I... I... I long for you.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; I long for you?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; I was so shocked I was lucky I said anything.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; It's okay, that's not bad.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; I don't like when a woman says, 'Make love to me', it's intimidating. The last time a woman said that to me, I wound up apologizing to her.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; Really?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; That's a lot of pressure.&nbsp; Make love to me.&nbsp; What am I, in the circus? What if I can't deliver?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; Oh, come on.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; I can't perform under pressure.&nbsp; That's why I never play anything for money, I choke.&nbsp; I could choke tonight.&nbsp; And she works in my office, can you imagine?&nbsp; She goes around telling everyone what happened?&nbsp; Maybe I should cancel, I have a very bad feeling about this.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; George, you're thinking too much.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; I know, I know, I can't stop it!<br>
							<br>
							
						(Cut to Elaine, talking with yet another guy on the couch.)<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE:&nbsp; Well, right now I'm reading manuscripts for Pendant Publishing.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (walking up)&nbsp; Pendant?&nbsp; Those bastards.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE:&nbsp; Excuse me.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; Listen, George is going home with this Ava from his office<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE:&nbsp; Really?&nbsp; Huh.&nbsp; What a world.&nbsp; So we can go now?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; Uh, no, he's taking the car.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE:&nbsp; Well, what are we gonna do for a ride?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; I don't know.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE:&nbsp; You don't know?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; Maybe Kramer can come pick us up.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE:&nbsp; Oh great, oh, this is great.&nbsp; How could you let him take the car?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; There's nothing I could do, it's part of the code.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Middle monologue]<br>
							<br>
							
						All plans between men are tentative.&nbsp; If one man should suddenly have an opportunity to pursue a woman, it's like these two guys never met each other ever in life.&nbsp; This is the male code.&nbsp; And it doesn't matter how important the arrangements are, I mean, most of the time when they scrub a space shuttle mission it's because one of the astronauts met someone on his way to the launch pad.&nbsp; They hold that countdown.&nbsp; He's leaning against the rocket talking to her, &quot;So listen, when I get back what do you say we get together for some Tang?&quot;<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Still at the Party]<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: (noticing Ava in a fur)&nbsp; Oh look at that.&nbsp; Look at what she's wearing. You see what she's wearing?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; Yeah, yeah, alright.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE:&nbsp; I can't believe she's walking around in that.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; Just don't make a scene.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE:&nbsp; Hey, is that real fur?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; Oh boy.<br>
							<br>
							
						AVA:&nbsp; It better be or my ex-husband owes me an explanation.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; Yeah, good night.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE:&nbsp; You don't care that innocent defenseless animals are being tortured so that you can look good?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; Could we talk about this some other time?<br>
							<br>
							
						AVA:&nbsp; Are you a vegetarian?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; Here we go.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE:&nbsp; Yeah, I eat fish occasionally.<br>
							<br>
							
						AVA:&nbsp; So you're a hypocrite.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; Hey, I've eaten frogs, so nobody's perfect.&nbsp; Anyway-<br>
							<br>
							
						AVA:&nbsp; Well, talk to me when you stop eating fish.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE:&nbsp; Fish don't feel any pain.<br>
							<br>
							
						AVA:&nbsp; How do you know?&nbsp; Do you communicate with fish?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE:&nbsp; Well, they're not kept in little cages.<br>
							<br>
							
						AVA:&nbsp; Ever seen a goldfish?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; Goldfish.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE:&nbsp; Yeah, yeah I've seen goldfish.&nbsp; They're not unhappy.<br>
							<br>
							
						AVA:&nbsp; Oh yeah, right.&nbsp; Swim around in a bowl for two weeks and get flushed down the toilet, that's a good life.&nbsp; (To George)&nbsp; Let's go.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE:&nbsp; Oh yeah, that's right.&nbsp; Go ahead, go ahead, maybe you can run over a squirrel!<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; That's why we're here in America.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; You're beautiful.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE:&nbsp; Call Kramer.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; Alright. (Approaches host)&nbsp; Excuse me, this is your party, right?<br>
							<br>
							
						STEVE:&nbsp; No, I just live here.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; Can I use your phone?<br>
							<br>
							
						STEVE:&nbsp; What's in it for me?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; A bigger bill?<br>
							<br>
							
						STEVE:&nbsp; He he, go for it.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Jerry picks up the phone and dials.)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; Krame?&nbsp; Sein.&nbsp; What are you doing?&nbsp; Well, I'm stuck out here on Long Island.&nbsp; What are your thoughts about taking a ride?&nbsp; You sure?&nbsp; Okay, but don't leave me hanging here.&nbsp; Okay, great.&nbsp; Let me give you directions.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Cut to several hours later.&nbsp; The party has ended.&nbsp; The hosts, Steve and Jenny, are cleaning up, Elaine and Jerry are still there.)<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE:&nbsp; You sure you don't need any help?<br>
							<br>
							
						JENNY:&nbsp; No, not really.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; I'm sure he'll be here any minute.<br>
							<br>
							
						JENNY: (To Steve)&nbsp; I want them out of here.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE:&nbsp; Call him again.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; I called, what should I do? (To Jenny) We really appreciate this.<br>
							<br>
							
						JENNY: (To Steve)&nbsp; It's two o'clock in the morning.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (noticing a coffee table book)&nbsp; Oh, you got the Civil War book.&nbsp; I saw some of that show, it was wonderful.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE:&nbsp; Six hundred and twenty million people died.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; Thousand.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE:&nbsp; Thousand.&nbsp; Six hundred and twenty thousand.&nbsp; The horror, the horror. (To Jerry)&nbsp; The wife keeps giving us dirty looks.&nbsp; Are you sure you gave him the right directions?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; (To Jenny)&nbsp; You're sure there's nothing we can do?<br>
							<br>
							
						JENNY:&nbsp; No!&nbsp; (To Steve)&nbsp; I am not going to bed with them in our house, this is ridiculous.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; You know a friend of my father's used to live right around here.&nbsp; Mike Wichter.&nbsp; He sold plastic straws.&nbsp; You know the ones?&nbsp; You could bend them.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE:&nbsp; Have you noticed, people don't use straws as much as they used to for some reason.<br>
							<br>
							
						JENNY:&nbsp; You know, it doesn't look as if your friend is coming.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; Oh, he's coming.<br>
							<br>
							
						JENNY:&nbsp; Maybe you should take a look at a train schedule.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Jenny sees a figure outside the kitchen window and screams.)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; That's him.<br>
							<br>
							
						JENNY:&nbsp; I'm going to bed!<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE:&nbsp; Thanks a lot.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; Thanks, great party.<br>
							<br>
							
						(As Jenny storms up the stairs there's a knock at the door, Steve answers.)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER:&nbsp; Hey, how ya doing?<br>
							<br>
							
						STEVE:&nbsp; Ah, look who's here.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER:&nbsp; I'm sorry.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; Hey, it's okay.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER:&nbsp; I had the directions on the seat right next to me, they flew out the window.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE:&nbsp; Then how did you find the place?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER:&nbsp; Well I knew the exit on the Long Island Expressway, and I thought that the address was 8713 Riviera Drive.&nbsp; Uh uh, so I drove around knocking on everybody's doors that had those numbers; 8317, 7813, 3718, 1837, whoo. Finally, I hit it.&nbsp; 8173.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; Anyway, thanks a lot for letting us stay here, Steve, I really owe you one.<br>
							<br>
							
						STEVE:&nbsp; No problem.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; And if you're ever in the city, you know, you want to come to a comedy club, whatever.<br>
							<br>
							
						STEVE:&nbsp; Hey, I might take you up on that.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (writing)&nbsp; Here's my address and number.&nbsp; And really, thanks again.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: (to Elaine)&nbsp; You better zip up.&nbsp; I couldn't get the top on the convertible up.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE:&nbsp; But it's cold out.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER:&nbsp; Yeah, wait till we get on the Expressway.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Jerry's at his apartment, talking on the phone.]<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; George, I've been sick all week.&nbsp; Elaine was too.&nbsp; Eighty miles an hour, forty degree temperature for fifty minutes.&nbsp; Do the math.&nbsp; Yeah, maybe I will get out.&nbsp; Hey, let me just stop off at the drug store first.&nbsp; Okay, meet me down there in fifteen minutes then we'll go do something.&nbsp; Yeah, Selwyn's.&nbsp; Okay bye.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Jerry hangs up and grabs his coat and there's a knock at the door.)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; Who is it?<br>
							<br>
							
						VOICE:&nbsp; Mr. Pocatello.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; Who?<br>
							<br>
							
						VOICE:&nbsp; You mean you don't recognize my voice?<br>
							<br>
							
						(Jerry opens the door.&nbsp; Steve steps in.)<br>
							<br>
							
						STEVE:&nbsp; Jerry, baby!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; Do I know you?<br>
							<br>
							
						STEVE:&nbsp; Boy this comedy's really frying your brain.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; I'm sorry, uh-<br>
							<br>
							
						STEVE:&nbsp; See, this is the kind of lasting impression I make on people.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; Oh, okay.<br>
							<br>
							
						STEVE:&nbsp; You said if I was ever in the city, I'm in the city.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; You certainly are.&nbsp; What's going on?<br>
							<br>
							
						STEVE:&nbsp; I'm just waiting for a lift back to the island, he won't be ready until eleven, so I figured I'd give you a break.&nbsp; I thought I'd see what it was like to hang out with someone in show business.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; Listen, I'm really sorry but I'm just on my way out to meet a friend.<br>
							<br>
							
						STEVE:&nbsp; Oh, come on, you can come up with something better than that.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; No, really, I just got off the phone with him.<br>
							<br>
							
						STEVE:&nbsp; I understand.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; Look, you can hang out here if you want.<br>
							<br>
							
						STEVE:&nbsp; Don't be so enthusiastic.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; No, it's-<br>
							<br>
							
						STEVE:&nbsp; I'm not gonna steal anything.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; No, of course not, just close the door when you leave.<br>
							<br>
							
						STEVE:&nbsp; I think I can do that.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; Really, I'm sorry.&nbsp; Maybe another time.<br>
							<br>
							
						STEVE:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; Let's have lunch.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Jerry and George are at the drug store.]<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; They guy's in my house right now.&nbsp; What a mistake that party was, I never should have gone.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; Yeah, me either.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; Oh, come on.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; What come on?&nbsp; Have you ever dated a woman that worked in your office?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; I've never had a job.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; You know the anxiety you feel on a date?&nbsp; That's what I have every day now.&nbsp; My worst nightmare's come true, every day is a date.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; That's one of Dante's nine stages of hell, isn't it?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; Ava was one of the reasons I used to like going to work, she was a friend.&nbsp; Now we sleep together and suddenly, I don't know how to talk to her. Every time I go to the bathroom I pass her desk.&nbsp; I have to plan little patter. I spend half my day writing.&nbsp; Then afterwards, I sit in my office and analyze how it went.&nbsp; If it was a good conversation, I don't go to the bathroom for the rest of the day.&nbsp; I see her laughing and talking with other people, they're all so loose and relaxed, I think, 'that used to be me.&nbsp; I want to go back there again.'<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; What are you gonna do?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; I have no choice, I'm quitting.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Cut back to Steve sitting alone on Jerry's couch watching TV.&nbsp; Kramer walks in and it takes a moment for him to recognize the visitor.]<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER:&nbsp; The party, Long Island?<br>
							<br>
							
						STEVE:&nbsp; Kramer, right?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER:&nbsp; Hey, what are you doing here?<br>
							<br>
							
						STEVE:&nbsp; I'm waiting for my ride.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER:&nbsp; Where's Jerry?<br>
							<br>
							
						STEVE:&nbsp; He split.&nbsp; Let me ask you something.&nbsp; Is there anything to drink in here or is that, like, a stupid question?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER:&nbsp; Well, Jerry, he doesn't have anything.&nbsp; (Sensing Steve's disappointment)&nbsp; Well, but I might have something.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Cut back to Jerry and George at the drugstore.&nbsp; Jerry is selecting medication.]<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; Alright, I'm gonna get this.&nbsp; This looks good.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; How much is that?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; Nine sixty.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; Nine sixty?&nbsp; Give it to me.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; Why?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; Don't worry, I got it.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; What do you mean, you got it?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; I got it.<br>
							<br>
							
						(George takes the box and begins to place it in his jacket)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; Since when are you treating me to medicine?&nbsp; What are you doing?&nbsp; You're stealing this, aren't you?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; I'm not stealing it.&nbsp; They owe me ten dollars.&nbsp; They stole from me.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; You're a lunatic.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; I have to do this, it's a matter of honor.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; What do you say to a person like you?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; Just walk.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; Oh.<br>
							<br>
							
						(A security guard approaches George.)<br>
							<br>
							
						SECURITY GUARD:&nbsp; Scuse me.&nbsp; What do you got there?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; What?<br>
							<br>
							
						SECURITY GUARD:&nbsp; What do you got in your shirt?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; Oh, I was gonna pay for this.<br>
							<br>
							
						SECURITY GUARD: (grabbing George by the elbow and walking him to the counter) Come with me.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (nervous)&nbsp; Where are you taking me?&nbsp; I was gonna pay for it.<br>
							<br>
							
						CASHIER: um-hmm.<br>
							<br>
							
						SECURITY GUARD:&nbsp; You don't think I remember you?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (more nervous)&nbsp; What are you talking about?<br>
							<br>
							
						SECURITY GUARD:&nbsp; I know who you are, I was watching you.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (panicky)&nbsp; What are you gonna do?&nbsp; Are you gonna call the police?<br>
							<br>
							
						(The Security Guard drags George away and Jerry steps to the counter.)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; Can I still buy this or is this evidence now?<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Cut back to Kramer and Steve, they're obviously tanked.&nbsp; Kramer is in the middle of a story.]<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER:&nbsp; So, I'm chasing these doves down the street and she's screaming at the top of her lungs, and then when the magician comes back from Europe, two of them turned brown!&nbsp; Well I followed the instructions!<br>
							<br>
							
						(They both erupt in raucous laughter.)<br>
							<br>
							
						STEVE: (hysterical)&nbsp; Ah, they turned brown!!&nbsp; Brown!! (the laughter winds down) So let me ask you something, you know any women we could call?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER:&nbsp; Not really.<br>
							<br>
							
						STEVE:&nbsp; Maybe we should call one of those escort services.&nbsp; I saw one of them advertised before on the cable station.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: (handing Steve the phone)&nbsp; 555-LOVE.<br>
							<br>
							
						STEVE:&nbsp; Hey, you want in on this?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER:&nbsp; No, I got a girl in the next building<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Jerry is outside his apartment door, as he puts in the key, he hears a woman's voice from inside.]<br>
							<br>
							
						VOICE:&nbsp; Now I want my money, mister, and I ain't leaving until I get it.&nbsp; Now I am through playing games with you, I got things to do.<br>
							<br>
							
						STEVE: (drunk and slurring)&nbsp; Oh Jerry!&nbsp; Jerry!&nbsp; Look who's here, it's Jerry<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; What the hell?<br>
							<br>
							
						STEVE:&nbsp; Jerry, this is Patti.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; Nice to meet you.<br>
							<br>
							
						PATTI:&nbsp; It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, I'm sure.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; What the hell is going on here?<br>
							<br>
							
						STEVE:&nbsp; I don't know, but I gotta do this more often.&nbsp; (The buzzer goes off) Ooh, there's my ride, finally.<br>
							<br>
							
						PATTI:&nbsp; I'm not gonna go anywhere until I get the rest of my money.<br>
							<br>
							
						STEVE:&nbsp; See ya, Jerr.&nbsp; And tell Kramer thanks and I'll call him tomorrow.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; Oh, Kramer huh?<br>
							<br>
							
						STEVE:&nbsp; Yeah, he's a hoot.&nbsp; Oh, goodbye, my dear.&nbsp; (trying to kiss Patti's hand as she pulls it away)&nbsp; Ouch.&nbsp; (To Jerry)&nbsp; Weekend of the 26th, come on out, we're having another party.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Steve walks out, leaving the front door open.)<br>
							<br>
							
						PATTI:&nbsp; I ain't leaving.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; Patti?<br>
							<br>
							
						PATTI:&nbsp; You got anything to drink?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; Alright, how much does he owe you?<br>
							<br>
							
						PATTI:&nbsp; Fifty dollars.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (taking out his wallet and handing over bills grudgingly)&nbsp; Fifty dollars.<br>
							<br>
							
						(In mid-payment, a police officer walks through the open door.)<br>
							<br>
							
						COP:&nbsp; This your apartment?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; Yeah, but--<br>
							<br>
							
						COP:&nbsp; You're under arrest for solicitation of prostitution.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; Wait a second, I--<br>
							<br>
							
						(Elaine walks in.)<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE:&nbsp; I brought you chicken soup.&nbsp; (To Patti)&nbsp; Is that real fur?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY &amp; COP:&nbsp; Oh boy.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Jerry and George are at Jerry's apartment, watching TV and eating pizza.]<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; You had Sgt. Chadway?&nbsp; Me too.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; He was a nice guy.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; Oh, great guy.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; Was there a red-headed guy there?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; The one with the long sideburns?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; Yeah.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; Where does he come off?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; Yeah, I know.&nbsp; There's no call for that kind of attitude.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:&nbsp; One of the guys in my cell threw a piece of gum at him.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:&nbsp; Oh, we all hated him.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Closing monologue]<br>
							<br>
							
						There's two types of favors, the big favor and the small favor.&nbsp; You can measure the size of the favor by the pause that a person takes after they ask you to 'do me a favor.'&nbsp; Small favor, small pause.&nbsp; Can you do me a favor, hand me that pencil?&nbsp; No pause at all.&nbsp; Big favors are, 'Could you do me a favor...' (huge pause, followed by closing credits.)<br>
