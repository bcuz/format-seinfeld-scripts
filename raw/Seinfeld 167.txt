							<br>
							[Setting: A car dealership] <br>
							<br>
							(Jerry and George are looking over some cars) <br>
							<br>
							GEORGE: When are they gonna have the flying cars, already? <br>
							<br>
							JERRY: Yeah, they have been promising that for a while.. <br>
							<br>
							GEORGE: Years. When we were kids, they made it seem like it was right around the corner. <br>
							<br>
							JERRY: I think Ed Begley Jr. has one. <br>
							<br>
							GEORGE: No. That's just electric. <br>
							<br>
							JERRY: What about Harrison Ford? He had one in, uh, Blade Runner. That was a cool one. <br>
							<br>
							GEORGE: (Sarcastically) What's the competition, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang? <br>
							<br>
							JERRY: Well, what do you think the big holdup is? <br>
							<br>
							GEORGE: The government is very touchy about us being in the air. Let us run around on the ground as much as we want. Anything in the air is a big production. <br>
							<br>
							JERRY: Yeah, right. And what about the floating cities? <br>
							<br>
							GEORGE: And the underwater bubble cities? <br>
							<br>
							JERRY: It's like we're living in the '50s here. <br>
							<br>
							(Kramer is bouncing up and down on the rear bumper of one of the cars for sale) <br>
							<br>
							KRAMER: It's good suspension! <br>
							<br>
							JERRY: (To Kramer) Would you stop it? You'll have plenty of time to destroy it after I get it. Hey, George, I'm buyin' this car. (Gestures to a black Saab) <br>
							<br>
							GEORGE: Shhh&#133; What is wrong with you? You never tell 'em you like the car. (Advising) You're not sure what you want. You don't even know why you're here. <br>
							<br>
							JERRY: (Gestures to his forehead) You&#146;re getting that vein again. <br>
							<br>
							GEORGE: I'm starving. We should have had lunch first.. <br>
							<br>
							JERRY: (Trying to quiet George down) It'll be twenty minutes. I told ya, Puddy's getting me an insider deal. <br>
							<br>
							GEORGE: Since when is Elaine's boyfriend selling cars? I thought he was a mechanic. <br>
							<br>
							JERRY: I guess he graduated. <br>
							<br>
							GEORGE: There's an easy move: go from screwin' you behind your back to screwin' you right to your face. <br>
							<br>
							(Kramer, in one of the cars, honks the horn) <br>
							<br>
							JERRY: (To Kramer) Thank you. <br>
							<br>
							GEORGE: Puddy&#146;s just gonna give you the car, huh? (Skeptically) You&#146;ll see. First they stick you with the undercoating, rust-proofing, dealer prep. Suddenly, you&#146;re on your back like a turtle. <br>
							<br>
							JERRY: All right. Calm down. <br>
							<br>
							GEORGE: My father had a car salesman buddy. He was gonna fix him up real nice. Next thing I know, I&#146;m gettin&#146; dropped of in a Le Car with a fabric sunroof. All the kids are shoutin&#146; at me, &quot;Hey, Le George! Bonjour, Le George! Let&#146;s stuff Le George in Le Locker!&quot; <br>
							<br>
							(Kramer is now on his back, under a car) <br>
							<br>
							KRAMER: Jerry, I don&#146;t think this thing is hooked up right. <br>
							<br>
							(Jerry and George go to enter the office buildings) <br>
							<br>
							JERRY: (To Kramer) All right, we&#146;re goin&#146; in. <br>
							<br>
							(A salesman walks up to Kramer. He&#146;s still under the car) <br>
							<br>
							SALESMAN: You&#146;ve got a good eye, there. I see you&#146;ve noticed the uni-body construction. I&#146;m Rick. Are you looking to buy or to lease? <br>
							<br>
							(Kramer emerges from under the car) <br>
							<br>
							KRAMER: Uh, borrow. It&#146;s for my friend. Yeah, he&#146;ll be buying.. <br>
							<br>
							RICK: Maybe I should talk to him. <br>
							<br>
							KRAMER: Oh, I don&#146;t think so. No, he&#146;s an entertainer. You know, all over the place. That&#146;s where I come in. <br>
							<br>
							RICK: I see. So, you&#146;re his manag- <br>
							<br>
							(Kramer hops into the car) <br>
							<br>
							KRAMER: Yeah, neighbor. That&#146;s right. Yeah, why don&#146;t we take this boiler out for a shakedown huh? <br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							[Scene cuts to the insides of the dealership building. Jerry and George are waiting for a salesman to assist them]<br>
							<br>
							GEORGE: Look at these salesmen. The only thing these guys fear is the walk-out. No matter what they say, you say, &quot;I&#146;ll walk out of here right now!&quot; <br>
							<br>
							(A salesman approaches) <br>
							<br>
							SALESMAN: Can I help you with something? <br>
							<br>
							GEORGE: (Threatening) Hold it! One more step and we&#146;re walkin&#146;! <br>
							<br>
							JERRY: (Scolding) George. (To salesman) Sorry, we&#146;re just waiting for David Puddy. <br>
							<br>
							GEORGE: (Still with a tone) He is. You don&#146;t know what I&#146;m doin&#146; here. <br>
							<br>
							(Elaine walks into the showroom with David Puddy) <br>
							<br>
							ELAINE: Hey. <br>
							<br>
							JERRY: Hey. <br>
							<br>
							PUDDY: Sorry I&#146;m late. <br>
							<br>
							ELAINE: (Full of pride) My new salesman boyfriend took me out to celebrate his promotion. <br>
							<br>
							JERRY: Ah. Where&#146;d you go? <br>
							<br>
							ELAINE: (Obviously embarrassed) Uh, to a restaurant. <br>
							<br>
							PUDDY: Arby&#146;s. <br>
							<br>
							ELAINE: I had the roast beef&#133;<br>
							<br>
							JERRY: So, Puddy, I decided I&#146;m gonna go with another 900 convertible. <br>
							<br>
							PUDDY: All right. Classic. (Holds his hand up) High-five. <br>
							<br>
							ELAINE: (Interrupting) David, can you tell me where the Xerox machine is? <br>
							<br>
							PUDDY: Oh, sure, babe. Salesman-only copy room (Points) right there. <br>
							<br>
							ELAINE: Oh. (Leaves for the room) <br>
							<br>
							PUDDY: (To Jerry and George) Hey, come on, guys. I&#146;ll show you the 900. <br>
							<br>
							GEORGE: (Mocking, skeptic) Yeah, you show us the 900. <br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							[Scene cuts to Kramer. He&#146;s in the car with the salesman, Rick, and they&#146;re driving an unknown street]<br>
							<br>
							RICK: &#133; And look at these features, Mr. Kramer: Anti-lock brakes, automatic climate control. Uh, (Points out the windshield) make a right at this corner, please. (Goes back to the features) An adjustable steering wheel, and&#133; Oh, Mr. Kramer, you missed the turn.. <br>
							<br>
							KRAMER: No, no, no, I didn&#146;t. <br>
							<br>
							RICK: Well, that&#146;s okay. (Pointing) We&#146;ll make this next right, and swing around to get back to the dealership. <br>
							<br>
							KRAMER: (Up to something) Well, it&#146;s a test drive, right? I never drive around here. If I&#146;m gonna recommend this car, I need to see that it&#146;ll handle my daily routine. <br>
							<br>
							RICK: Well where are we going? <br>
							<br>
							KRAMER: Just a little place I like to call, &quot;You&#146;ll see&quot;. <br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							[Setting: Puddy&#146;s office] <br>
							<br>
							(George and Jerry are in conference with Puddy) <br>
							<br>
							GEORGE: I&#146;m starving. You got any of those free donuts you use to soften people up? <br>
							<br>
							PUDDY: (Pointing out his office door) By the service department. <br>
							<br>
							GEORGE: (Getting up, he addresses Jerry) All right, remember: no rust-proofing. Commit to nothing. If you have to speak - mumble. <br>
							<br>
							JERRY: (As George is leaving for the donuts) Au revoir, Le George. <br>
							<br>
							GEORGE: Don&#146;t think it can&#146;t happen! (Leaves) <br>
							<br>
							JERRY: So, Puddy, this is a pretty good move for you, huh? No more &quot;grease monkey&quot;. <br>
							<br>
							PUDDY: I don&#146;t care for that term. <br>
							<br>
							JERRY: Oh. Sorry, I didn&#146;t know.. <br>
							<br>
							PUDDY: No, I don&#146;t know too many monkeys who could take apart a fuel injector. <br>
							<br>
							JERRY: I saw one once that could do sign language. <br>
							<br>
							PUDDY: Yeah, I saw that one. Uh.. Koko. <br>
							<br>
							JERRY: Yeah, Koko. <br>
							<br>
							PUDDY: Right, Koko. That chimp&#146;s all right. (Holds up his hand) High-five. <br>
							<br>
							(Returning, George sees Jerry reluctantly slap hands with Puddy) <br>
							<br>
							GEORGE: Hey, hey, hey! What&#146;s goin&#146; on here? (To Jerry) You didn&#146;t agree to anything, did ya? <br>
							<br>
							JERRY: No. We both just saw the same monkey. <br>
							<br>
							GEORGE: (Aggravated) Well, I got screwed on the donuts. There were none left. Heh! <br>
							<br>
							PUDDY: (Standing up) Well, there&#146;s a vending machine. I could show you where it is. (Leaves, showing George the way) <br>
							<br>
							GEORGE: (To Jerry) Hey, gimme a dollar. <br>
							<br>
							JERRY: (Getting a dollar out) Where&#146;s your money? <br>
							<br>
							GEORGE: (Talking it) I&#146;m here helpin&#146; you. <br>
							<br>
							(Elaine enters) <br>
							<br>
							ELAINE: Hey. Where&#146;s Puddy? The copy machine is broken. <br>
							<br>
							GEORGE: (On his way out) Heh, heh, heh. That&#146;s what they want you to think. <br>
							<br>
							JERRY: Hey, Elaine, have you noticed your boyfriend has developed an annoying little habit? <br>
							<br>
							ELAINE: (Squints, imitating Puddy) The squinting? <br>
							<br>
							JERRY: No. <br>
							<br>
							ELAINE: (Stares ahead, again, imitating Puddy) The staring? <br>
							<br>
							JERRY: No. He keeps asking me to give him a high-five. <br>
							<br>
							ELAINE: (Shrugging) I thought all guys do that. <br>
							<br>
							JERRY: Slapping hands is the lowest form of male primate ritual. In fact, even some of them have moved on - they&#146;re doing sign language now. <br>
							<br>
							ELAINE: It&#146;s that bad? <br>
							<br>
							JERRY: What do you think the Nazis were doin&#146;? (Imitates the Nazi&#146;s salute) That was the heil-five. <br>
							<br>
							ELAINE: (Pointing out) Isn&#146;t that from your act, like, ten years ago? <br>
							<br>
							JERRY: (Slightly embarrassed) It was a good bit in the &#145;80&#146;s, and it&#146;s still relatable today. <br>
							<br>
							(Puddy approaches them) <br>
							<br>
							PUDDY: Good news. We got a 900 in black. That&#146;s the hot color. (Holds up his hand) High-five. <br>
							<br>
							(Elaine and Jerry exchange looks) <br>
							<br>
							ELAINE: Um, David, you know what? Can you come help me fix the copy machine? Come.<br>
							<br>
							(Elaine takes Puddy&#146;s arm, leading him to the room) <br>
							<br>
							PUDDY: (Pointing at Jerry) You owe me five. <br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							[Setting: Dealership back room] <br>
							<br>
							(George is eyeing a Twix candy bar through the vending machine glass) <br>
							<br>
							GEORGE: Twix.. (Makes various noises) B-5. <br>
							<br>
							(George put in his dollar, but the machine rejects it. He tries to jam it in, same result. He tries one more time - unsuccessful) <br>
							<br>
							GEORGE: Ah, come on! <br>
							<br>
							(A heavy-set mechanic approaches and stands in line behind George to use the vending machine. George steps back to let him use it. The machine readily accepts the mechanic&#146;s dollar) <br>
							<br>
							GEORGE: Ah, excuse me. Do you have, uh, change of a dollar? <br>
							<br>
							MECHANIC: (While retrieving his candy) No. <br>
							<br>
							GEORGE: Could I, uh, could I trade you for another dollar? <br>
							<br>
							MECHANIC: (While walking away) Don&#146;t have one. <br>
							<br>
							GEORGE: (Stopping him) Ah, excuse me. When your, uh, when your wallet was open, I - I glanced inside, and I couldn&#146;t help but notice that you have several crisp dollar bills. <br>
							<br>
							MECHANIC: (Calm) You&#146;re incorrect. <br>
							<br>
							GEORGE: (Persistent) Perhaps you could look again, please? I&#146;m very hungry. <br>
							<br>
							MECHANIC: (While taking his exit) We had donuts earlier. <br>
							<br>
							GEORGE: (Losing it) I guess everyone here enjoys giving the old screwgie, huh?! You&#146;re all doin&#146; a hell of a job! (Looks longingly at the Twix in the machine) Ho, ho. What I would do with you.. <br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							[Setting: Dealership car] <br>
							<br>
							(Rick and Kramer are still on the test-drive. The back seat is filled with various items - those including a giant, stuffed Tweety bird) <br>
							<br>
							RICK: Uh, Mr. Kramer, we&#146;re really not allowed to use the cars to run errands. <br>
							<br>
							KRAMER: Now look, Rick. I&#146;m very close to giving this car, that my celebrity friend is considering, my full endorsement. (Looks out the window) Oooh, Let&#146;s see if I can get a smile from these femininas.. (Yells out to them) Hey, Ladies! (Points to the car) It&#146;s the Saab 900! What do you think? Can I interest you in a little supplemental restraint?! (They obviously do something to offend him. Kramer reacts with a face) Geez&#133; <br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							[Setting: Dealership back room] <br>
							<br>
							(Jerry walks up to the vending machine. George is on his stomach, reaching under the vending machine for change) <br>
							<br>
							JERRY: (Tapping the door you lift to retrieve your candy on the machine) I think the candy comes out over there. <br>
							<br>
							GEORGE: People can drop change down here, Jerry. And they&#146;re too lazy to pick it up. <br>
							<br>
							JERRY: Either that, or they&#146;ve got a weird little hang-up about lying face-down in filth. Why don&#146;t you just go to the cashier? <br>
							<br>
							(George gets up) <br>
							<br>
							GEORGE: The cashier is at lunch - which is where I&#146;d like to be. <br>
							<br>
							JERRY: How much was under there? <br>
							<br>
							GEORGE: (Looking at his finger) I think somethin&#146; bit me. I just need another nickel. <br>
							<br>
							JERRY: (While fishing through his pocket for change) Hey, Puddy thinks I should go for the CD player. What do you think? (Hands him a nickel) <br>
							<br>
							GEORGE: Ho, ho, ho! He&#146;s got a live one. He&#146;s just reeling his big fish in! <br>
							<br>
							JERRY: Hey, can I have my dollar back? <br>
							<br>
							GEORGE: (Stingy) It&#146;s wrinkled. It&#146;s worthless. <br>
							<br>
							(Jerry gives George a look, then leaves. George hurriedly puts the money into the machine) <br>
							<br>
							GEORGE: (As the Twix starts to move) Ha, ha, ha, ha! (The Twix gets stuck in the spindle right before falling. George begins to pound the machine) Come on! Jump! <br>
							<br>
							(A man holding a donut walks past George) <br>
							<br>
							MAN: They just put out some more donuts. <br>
							<br>
							GEORGE: They did? <br>
							<br>
							MAN: (Holding his up) Last one. <br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							[Setting: Dealership car] <br>
							<br>
							(Kramer&#146;s still on the road with Rick) <br>
							<br>
							KRAMER: Well, just one more errand and we can head back. <br>
							<br>
							RICK: Actually, it looks like we&#146;re gonna need some gas. <br>
							<br>
							KRAMER: Oh? Well, how much gas do you think is in there right now? <br>
							<br>
							RICK: (Looking) Well, it&#146;s on &quot;E&quot;. <br>
							<br>
							KRAMER: You know, Rick, oftentimes, Jerry - he lends me his car and I find myself in a situation where the car is almost out of gas. But, for a variety of reasons, I don&#146;t want to be the one responsible for purchasing costly gasoline. <br>
							<br>
							RICK: (Pointing out) So, you want to know how far you can drive your friend&#146;s car for free. <br>
							<br>
							KRAMER: (In the spotlight, his voice goes high) Well, I make it up to him in other ways. <br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							[Setting: Dealership back room] <br>
							<br>
							(George enters with a salesman, regarding the machine) <br>
							<br>
							GEORGE: As you will see, the candy bar is paid for, and yet, remains dangling in the machine. (Notices that the Twix slot is completely empty) Hey, it&#146;s gone. Where is my Twix? (Quickly looks around. His sights fall on the window of a door labeled &quot;Employees Only&quot;. The same mechanic from before is eating a candy bar) What?! That guy&#146;s eatin&#146; it! <br>
							<br>
							SALESMAN: Well, how do you know that one&#146;s yours? <br>
							<br>
							GEORGE: Uh, it was dangling! There were only two left in the machine! He must&#146;ve bought one, and gotten both. <br>
							<br>

							GEORGE: No! (The salesman walks away. He addresses the mechanic through the door&#146;s window) Hey! Hey! I see you! That is my Twix! (The mechanic eats the last of the Twix, obviously to make George even more angered. It works) Oh, ha, ha! Ho, ho! <br>

							ELAINE: David, um, I.. <br>
							<br>
							PUDDY: (Still holding out his hand) Don&#146;t leave me hangin&#146;. <br>

							ELAINE: You&#146;re a salesman now - and the high-five is&#133; it&#146;s very &#147;grease monkey.&#148; <br>
							<br>
							PUDDY: What did I tell you about that? <br>
							<br>
							ELAINE: Ah, I, I&#146;m sorry, but the high-five is just so stupid. <br>
							<br>
							PUDDY: (Somewhat hurt) Oh yeah? I&#146;ll tell you what&#146;s stupid. You. Stupid. <br>

							ELAINE: (Sarcastically) Oh, that is really mature. <br>
							<br>
							PUDDY: Yeah? So are you. You&#146;re the grease monkey. <br>

							<br>
							JERRY: &quot;Rust-proofing&quot;? <br>

							GEORGE: Excuse me. I believe you just ate my Twix bar. It was dangling. And when you purchased your Twix bar, you got a little freebie, and you never bothered to ask why, or seek out its rightful owner. <br>
							<br>
							MECHANIC: First of all, it wasn&#146;t a Twix. It was a 5th Avenue bar. <br>
							<br>
							GEORGE: Huh. You must think I&#146;m pretty stupid. (The mechanic shoots him a look as if he cleary does think he&#146;s stupid) That was no 5th Avenue bar. I can see the crumb right there in the corner of your lip! Now, that-that-that is a cookie - and we all know that Twix is the only candy bar with the cookie crunch. <br>
							<br>
							MECHANIC: It&#146;s uh, it&#146;s just a little nougat. <br>
							<br>
							GEORGE: Nougat? Please. I think I&#146;ve reached the point in my life where I can tell the difference between nougat and cookie. So let&#146;s not just say things that we both know are obvious fabrications. <br>
							<br>
							MECHANIC: (Pointing to George&#146;s forehead) You know, you&#146;re gettin&#146; a little vein there.. <br>

							JERRY: No, last one. Listen, you gotta help me out. Elaine and Puddy just broke up, he&#146;s treatin&#146; me just like a regular customer, now! <br>
							<br>
							GEORGE: I tried to tell you, but you wouldn&#146;t listen. No, ho, ho! You were gonna get a deal, huh? There&#146;s no laws in this place. Anything goes! It&#146;s Thunderdome! <br>

							<br>
							RICK: Have you ever been completely below the slash? <br>
							<br>

							<br>
							GEORGE: All right, Puddy, listen, and listen good: I need to know the name of that mechanic that walks around here. Big guy, a liar. Short name. Sam? Moe? Sol?! <br>

							<br>
							GEORGE: He might as well have! I caught him, and his face was covered in chocolate and cookie crumbs. <br>

							GEORGE: Oh, it was. But he claimed it was a 5th Avenue bar. <br>
