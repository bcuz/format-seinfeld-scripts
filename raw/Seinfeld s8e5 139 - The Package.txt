							<br>[Kramer and Newman at the park, smoking cigars]<br>
										<br>
										KRAMER: Well, I really miss the Bermuda Triangle.<br>
										<br>
										NEWMAN: I guess there's not much action down there these days.<br>
										<br>
										KRAMER: Oh, there's action. There's plenty of action. That damned alien autopsy is stealing all the headlines.<br>
										<br>
										NEWMAN: Yeah, tell me about it.<br>
										<br>
										KRAMER: See, what they gotta do is loose a plane or a Greenpeace boat in there. See, that would get the triangle going again.<br>
										<br>
										NEWMAN: What keeps the water in there? I mean, why doesn't it disappear?<br>
										<br>
										KRAMER: What would be the point in taking the water?<br>
										<br>
										NEWMAN: It's gorgeous water. (pause) Do we own Bermuda?<br>
										<br>
										KRAMER: No. It belongs to the British.<br>
										<br>
										NEWMAN: Lucky krauts.<br>
										<br>
										KRAMER: So, what do you think about that alien autopsy?<br>
										<br>
										NEWMAN: Oh, that's real.<br>
										<br>
										KRAMER: I think so too.<br>

										<br>
										
							ATTENDANT: The doctor will be with you in a moment. <br>
										<br>
										
							(Elaine looking at her chart) <br>
										<br>
										
							ELAINE: Difficult? <br>
										<br>
										
							DOCTOR: Elaine. You shouldn't be reading that. So tell me about this rash of yours. <br>
										<br>
										
							ELAINE: Well it's, it's..... You know I noticed that somebody wrote in my chart that I was difficult in January of 92 and I have to tell you that I remember that appointment exactly. You see this nurse asked me to put a gown on but it was a mole on my shoulder and I specifically wore a tank top so I wouldn't have to put a gown on. You know there made of paper. <br>
										<br>
										
							DOCTOR: Well that was a long time ago. How about if I just erase it. Now about that rash...... <br>
										<br>
										
							ELAINE: But it was in pen. You fake erase. <br>
										<br>
										
							DOCTOR: All right Miss Benes. This doesn't look to serious. You'll be fine.<br>
										<br>
										
							ELAINE: What are you writing? Doctor. <br>
										<br>
										<br>
										<br>
										
							[George at Photo Shop] <br>
										<br>
										
							SHEILA: Here you go. <br>
										<br>
										
							GEORGE: Thanks. <br>
										<br>
										
							SHEILA: I hope you got that mustard stain out of your shirt. <br>
										<br>
										
							GEORGE: Ohhhhhh <br>
										<br>
										<br>
										<br>
										
							[Jerry, Kramer, and George at the apartment] <br>
										<br>
										
							JERRY: No. All you got to do is jiggle it with this screwdriver. <br>
										<br>
										
							GEORGE: Smile <br>
										<br>
										
							JERRY: What are you doing? <br>
										<br>
										
							GEORGE: I meet this women, Sheila. She works down at the one hour photo pace. She's got this incredible smile. Like she's got extra teeth or something <br>
										<br>
										
							JERRY: Extra teeth. I love that look. <br>
										<br>
										
							GEORGE: Hey check this out. I go to pick up my pictures and she says &quot; I hope you got that mustard stain out of your shirt.&quot; <br>
										<br>
										
							JERRY: What mustard stain? <br>
										<br>
										
							GEORGE: Don't you see. She's looking at my pictures. <br>
										<br>
										
							JERRY: Why did you take a picture of a mustard stain? <br>
										<br>
										
							GEORGE: That's got nothing to do with it. <br>
										<br>
										
							JERRY: I see. She's looking. <br>
										<br>
										
							GEORGE: Yesssss. <br>
										<br>
										
							KRAMER: Hey, you got to get this thing fixed. <br>
										<br>
										
							JERRY: They've tried to fix it. But it keeps coming back the same. <br>
										<br>
										
							KRAMER: Would you like a refund? <br>
										<br>
										
							JERRY: Well I can't the warranty expired two years ago. <br>
										<br>
										
							KRAMER: Would you be interested? <br>
										<br>
										
							JERRY: Well how are you going..... <br>
										<br>
										
							KRAMER: Would you? <br>
										<br>
										
							JERRY: I guess I would. <br>
										<br>
										
							KRAMER: Yeah, yeah. <br>
										<br>
										
							(Elaine walks in) <br>
										<br>
										
							ELAINE: You are not going to believe what happened to me at the doctors office today. <br>
										<br>
										
							JERRY: Not the gown again. <br>
										<br>
										
							ELAINE: No, no. I was looking at my chart and it said I was difficult. Why would they write that? <br>
										<br>
										
							JERRY: They have gotten to know you. <br>
										<br>
										
							(Kramer leaves with Jerry's stereo) <br>
										<br>
										
							ELAINE: Then the doctor writes more stuff down and doesn't even look at my rash. <br>
										<br>
										
							GEORGE: Why don't you find a doctor that doesn't know your difficult. <br>
										<br>
										
							ELAINE: Oh come on. I'm not difficult. I'm easy. <br>
										<br>
										
							JERRY: Why because you dress casual and sleep with a lot of guys. <br>
										<br>
										
							ELAINE: Listen to me you little shi........ <br>
										<br>
										
							GEORGE: Smile. <br>
										<br>
										<br>
										<br>
										
							[Elaine at another doctor's office] <br>
										<br>
										
							DOCTOR: Well Elaine you really didn't have to put on the gown. <br>
										<br>
										
							ELAINE: Oh it's my pleasure. I love these. In fact I got one at home. It's perfect when you just want to throw something on. <br>
										<br>
										
							(Nurse hands the doctor her chart) <br>
										<br>
										
							DOCTOR: All rightly. Let me just review your history before we begin. <br>
										<br>
										
							ELAINE: Where did you get my chart? <br>
										<br>
										
							DOCTOR: From your last doctor. It's a standard procedure. <br>
										<br>
										
							ELAINE: You know I can tell you my whole history. Let's just....... <br>
										<br>
										
							DOCTOR: Okay. Let's take a look. Well that doesn't look to serious. You'll be fine. <br>
										<br>
										
							ELAINE: Please, please. It's really, really itchy. <br>
										<br>
										
							(Doctor writes more stuff in her chart) <br>

										<br>
										
							POSTAL WORKER: Are you refusing delivery? <br>
										<br>
										
							JERRY: Maybe I am. <br>
										<br>
										
							POSTAL WORKER DANNY: Why would you do that? <br>
										<br>
										
							JERRY: I've never done it before. <br>
										<br>
										
							POSTAL WORKER DANNY: Why start now? <br>
										<br>
										
							JERRY: Why not? <br>
										<br>
										
							POSTAL WORKER DANNY: All right. <br>
										<br>
										
							(George walks in) <br>
										<br>
										
							GEORGE: Why did you refuse the package. Everybody loves a package. <br>
										<br>
										
							JERRY: I don't know it was weird. Crazy printing. I don't know who it was from. <br>
										<br>
										
							GEORGE: What do you think it's a bomb? <br>
										<br>
										
							JERRY: It's not totally impossible. <br>
										<br>
										
							GEORGE: Oh the ego on you. <br>
										<br>
										
							JERRY: Why can't I be bombable? <br>
										<br>
										
							GEORGE: Who's going to bomb you. An airline for all the stupid little peanut jokes. <br>
										<br>
										
							JERRY: I suppose you think your bombable. <br>
										<br>
										
							GEORGE: Hey. There is a couple of people that wouldn't mind having me out of the way. <br>
										<br>
										
							JERRY: There's more than a couple. <br>
										<br>
										
							GEORGE: Hey. Check these out. I just picked them up from Sheila. She must have loved these. <br>
										<br>
										
							JERRY: You don't have a Mercedes. <br>
										<br>
										
							GEORGE: I know. I just sort of leaned on it so it would look like it was mine. <br>
										<br>
										
							JERRY: The driver seems a little put out. <br>
										<br>
										
							GEORGE: No. He was fine with it. Check that out. <br>
										<br>
										
							JERRY: Is that Burt Reynolds? <br>
										<br>
										
							GEORGE: Wax Museum. <br>
										<br>
										
							JERRY: Oh. <br>
										<br>
										
							GEORGE: Oh. What is this? <br>
										<br>
										
							JERRY: That's a lot of skin. <br>
										<br>
										
							GEORGE: This must be Sheila from the photo place. <br>
										<br>
										
							JERRY: You can barely see her face. <br>
										<br>
										
							GEORGE: She must have slipped it in here. <br>
										<br>
										
							(Kramer walks in) <br>
										<br>
										
							KRAMER: I I I <br>

							JERRY: Where are you going? <br>
										<br>
										
							GEORGE: To ask her out. <br>
										<br>
										
							KRAMER: No, no. Your not playing the game. <br>
										<br>
										
							GEORGE: What game? <br>
										<br>
										
							KRAMER: She goes to these lengths to entice you and your only response is &quot; Gee I really like your picture. Would you like to go out on a date with me please. &quot; <br>
										<br>
										
							GEORGE: No good? <br>
										<br>
										
							KRAMER: George. It's the timeless art of seduction. You got to join in the dance. She sends you an enticing photo, you send her one right back. <br>
										<br>
										
							GEORGE: Oh, I don't know. <br>
										<br>
										
							KRAMER: Well as you know I've always been something of a photog. <br>

										<br>
										
							GEORGE: Well why don't you get a hold of it and change what you don't like. <br>
										<br>
										
							ELAINE: You can't change your chart. It's your chart. <br>
										<br>
										
							GEORGE: I am in and out of my personnel file at work all the time. <br>
										<br>
										
							ELAINE: You are!?! <br>
										<br>

										<br>
										
							ELAINE: Yeah. I sent one to everyone I know. Remember my Christmas card. <br>
										<br>
										
							GEORGE: Oh yeah the nipple. But besides that. How did you feel about Kramer's work? <br>

										<br>
										
							GEORGE: So it was a good experience. <br>
										<br>
										
							ELAINE: Oh yeah. In fact I like the picture so much I cropped out the nipple and am using as my health club ID. <br>

							ATTENDANT: He can't see you Miss Benes, he's busy. <br>
										<br>
										
							ELAINE: Oh come on. Have some compassion. Okay well I hope it's contagious <br>
										<br>
										
							(Elaine rubs the attendants phone on her neck. Soon after Elaine finds her chart and runs to the elevator) <br>
										<br>
										
							ELAINE: Come on. Move. (elevator doors reopen; Dr. Burke and two orderlies are revealed) Oh hi Dr. Burke. I didn't know if uh.... <br>
										<br>
										
							DR. BURKE: The chart Miss Benes. <br>

										<br>
										
							UNCLE LEO: What should I do with it? <br>
										<br>
										
							JERRY: I don't know what you should do with it. <br>
										<br>
										
							GEORGE: Tell him to open it. <br>
										<br>
										
							JERRY: I am not going to treat my uncle like a bomb defusing robot. <br>
										<br>
										
							UNCLE LEO: Jerry, Your cousin Jeffrey is in the Parks Production of &quot;The Mikado&quot;. I want you to go see it with me. <br>

							[Jerry's apartment later that day; Jerry and Elaine] <br>
										<br>
										
							ELAINE: So it wasn't a bomb. <br>
										<br>
										
							JERRY: No, No bomb. <br>
										<br>
										
							ELAINE: Well then what? <br>
										<br>
										
							JERRY: Oh stupid Leo was using one of those oven cleaners. He left the canister in there and the pilot light was on. The whole thing blew up. <br>
										<br>
										
							ELAINE: But he's okay? <br>
										<br>
										
							JERRY: Yeah but the explosion singed off his eyebrows, mustache everything. He's all smooth now. Look's like a seal. <br>

							(Elaine on phone) <br>
										<br>
										
							ELAINE: Yeah I am still holding. <br>

							KRAMER: Hey you got it. <br>
										<br>
										
							JERRY: What happened to my stereo? It's all smashed up. <br>
										<br>
										
							KRAMER: That's right. Now it looks like it was broken during shipping and I insured it for $400. <br>
										<br>
										
							JERRY: But you were supposed to get me a refund. <br>
										<br>
										
							KRAMER: You can't get a refund. Your warranty expired two years ago. <br>
										<br>
										
							JERRY: So were going to make the Post Office pay for my new stereo? <br>
										<br>
										
							KRAMER: It's just a write off for them. <br>
										<br>
										
							JERRY: How is it a write off? <br>
										<br>
										
							KRAMER: They just write it off. <br>
										<br>
										
							JERRY: Write it off what? <br>
										<br>
										
							KRAMER: Jerry all these big companies they write off everything <br>
										<br>
										
							JERRY: You don't even know what a write off is. <br>
										<br>
										
							KRAMER: Do you? <br>
										<br>
										
							JERRY: No. I don't. <br>
										<br>
										
							KRAMER: But they do and they are the ones writing it off. <br>

							JERRY: I wish I just had the last twenty seconds of my life back. <br>
										<br>
										
							(Elaine still on phone) <br>
										<br>
										
							ELAINE: What?!? He doesn't have one appointment this whole month!?! Oh come on. I am dying here man. Hello, hello. <br>
										<br>
										
							JERRY: Still no luck <br>
										<br>
										
							(Kramer leaves with a fan) <br>
										<br>
										
							ELAINE: Jerry I am at doctor Zimmerman. I am at the end of the alphabet. <br>
										<br>
										
							JERRY: There's no Zorn or Zoutraph. <br>

										<br>
										
							JERRY: Hey what about Dr. Resnick My Uncle Leo is going to see him tomorrow .<br>
										<br>
										
							ELAINE: Dr. Resnick. He's not listed. <br>
