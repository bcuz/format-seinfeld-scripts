						==================================================================<br>
							<br>
							
						[Waitress giving Elaine her meal at Monk's.]<br>
							<br>
							
						WAITRESS: Careful, this plate is extremely hot.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Elaine touching the plate.)<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Thank you. Ow!<br>
							<br>
							
						WAITRESS: I just told you it was hot. Why'd you touch it?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I just wanted to know what your idea of 'hot' is.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Puddy entering Monk's in a fur coat)<br>
							<br>
							
						PUDDY: Hey, babe. You ready to hit the ice?<br>
							<br>
							
						(Elaine cracking up when she sees Puddy's coat.)<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I am ready to skate up a-- ha, ha, ha...Why are you wearing that?<br>
							<br>
							
						PUDDY: It's my winter coat.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: A fur?<br>
							<br>
							
						(Puddy sits down in the booth.)<br>
							<br>
							
						PUDDY: Is there a problem?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: A seemingly infinite supply.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Elaine touching the plate again.)<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Ow! Careful, it's hot.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Puddy touching the plate.)<br>
							<br>
							
						PUDDY: Ow!<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Jerry, in his apartment with Elaine and George.]<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: So, Puddy wear's a man fur?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: He was struttin' around the coffee shop like Stein Erickson.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: And, of course, you find fur morally reprehensible.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Eh, anti-fur. I mean, who has the energy anymore? This is more about hanging off the arm of an idiot.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: And this is the first you're seeing of the coat?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: We never dated in winter.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You might want to get a look at that bathing suit drawer.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oh, I walked by Bloomingdale's the other day, and I saw that massage chair we want to get Joe Mayo as an apartment gift.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: An apartment-warming gift? We got to give presents to people for moving? Birthdays, Christmas, it's enough gifts. I would like one month off.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Kramer said it's a perfect gift. That's what we're gettin' him.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: All right, but we're not buyin' it at Bloomingdale's. I will buy it, you pay me back later. I'll sniff out a deal. I have a sixth sense.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Cheapness is not a sense.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I can't stand Joe Mayo's parties. You know, the second you walk in, he's got you workin' for him. 'Hey, can you do me a favor? Can you keep an eye on the ice, make sure we have enough?' Uh...<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I had a great time at the last one. I was in charge of the music. I turned that mother out.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer enters Jerry's apartment with Newman.)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Hey.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hey.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: You got any pliers?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What, has Newman got another army man stuck in his ear?<br>
							<br>
							
						NEWMAN: Hilarious.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Newman and I are reversing the peepholes on our door. So you can see in.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Why?<br>
							<br>
							
						NEWMAN: To prevent an ambush.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Yeah, so now I can peek to see if anyone is waiting to jack me with a sock full of pennies.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: But then anyone can just look in and see you.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Our policy is, we're comfortable with our bodies. You know, if someone wants to help themselves to an eyefull, well, we say, 'Enjoy the show.'<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I'm sorry I can't stay for the... second act.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Jerry pulls a stub of paper out of his wallet.)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hey, George. Here's the model number on that chair, by the way.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Mmm... Nice wallet.<br>
							<br>
							
						NEWMAN: Wallet.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What?<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer showing Jerry the contents of his pocket)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Nobody carries wallets anymore. I mean, they went out with powdered wigs. Yeah, see here's what you need. Just a couple of cards and your bankroll. See, keep the big bills on the outside.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: That's a five.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer singing as he switches his peephole around)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: I'm on the Mexican, whoa ohh, radio...<br>
							<br>
							
						(Silvio coming up behind Kramer)<br>
							<br>
							
						SILVIO: Eh, what are you doing?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Hey, Silvio. Yeah, I'm reversing my peephole.<br>
							<br>
							
						SILVIO: Hey, you know you gotta get permission from me. I'm the super. Who said you could do that?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Well, who says I can do any of the things I do in my place?<br>
							<br>
							
						SILVIO: Like what?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Well, I... uh, nothing. No, I'll, um, I'll switch it back.<br>
							<br>
							
						SILVIO: No, no, no, no. No, that's all right.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Well, that's good. Because, uh, Newman and I--<br>
							<br>
							
						SILVIO: Newman? He did this, too?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Well, yeah.<br>
							<br>
							
						SILVIO: I deal with him.<br>
							<br>
							
						(George showing Jerry a newspaper ad.)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Hey, look at this. This is the same massage chair we're gettin' for Joe Mayo, $60 cheaper.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Except the store's in Delaware.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I'll have 'em overnight it.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Maybe cheapness is a sense. You know it is better without this big wallet. It's more comfortable.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: It doesn't matter if it's more comfortable. It's wrong.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Why?<br>
							<br>
							
						(George pulling out his wallet.)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Because important things go in a case. You got a skull for your brain, a plastic sleeve for your comb, and a wallet for your money.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Jerry holding up a hamburger while holding George's wallet.)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: But look at this thing. It's-it's huge. You got more cow here than here.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I need everything in there.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Jerry looking through George's wallet )<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Irish money?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I might go there.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Show this card at any participating Orlando-area Exxon station...to get your free 'Save the Tiger' poster.<br>
							<br>
							
						(George grabbing back his wallet.)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: All right, just gimme that. And gimme some of those Sweet &amp; Lows.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Newman walks up to Kramer's door, looks into his reverse peephole, and sees Kramer, wearing an open shirt, scratching his stomach with a backscratcher, with opera music playing in the background. Newman knocks on the door, and Kramer startingly peers into his reverse peephole)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Who is it?<br>
							<br>
							
						NEWMAN: It's Newman.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: What do you want? I'm in the middle of something.<br>
							<br>
							
						NEWMAN: I can't believe I'm being evicted.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: What? What are you talking about?<br>
							<br>
							
						NEWMAN: The reverse peepholes. Silvio said I'm an agitator and I'm out of the building.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: No. No, he can't do that.<br>
							<br>
							
						NEWMAN: I'm homeless! I'm gonna be out on a street corner, dancing for nickels. I'll be with the hobos in the trainyard, eating out of a bucket.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Come on, we'll go and talk to him, and we'll straighten this thing out.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer closes his door behind him to go with Newman, when Newman sees that he's still wearing his open shirt)<br>
							<br>
							
						NEWMAN: Uh, you, uh, you better put something on.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Jerry, at Joe Mayo's party with George.]<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: George, I am loving this no wallet thing.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: A man carries a wallet.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You know, the very fact that you oppose this makes me think I'm onto something.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Joe Mayo, coming up to George and Jerry.)<br>
							<br>
							
						JOY MAYO: Hey, Jerry.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hey, Joe Mayo. Nice place.<br>
							<br>
							
						JOY MAYO: Thanks. George, can you do me a favor and stay by the phone in case anybody calls and needs directions?<br>
							<br>
							
						(George tossing his coat on a chair.)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Love to.<br>
							<br>
							
						JOY MAYO: Thanks. Jerry...<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Music?<br>
							<br>
							
						JOY MAYO: Actually, can you keep an eye on the aquarium and make sure nobody taps on the glass?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: But I could do that and the music.<br>
							<br>
							
						JOY MAYO: Oh, no, don't worry about the music. Just... have fun!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I was ready to get jiggy with it.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Elaine entering the party with Puddy who's wearing his fur coat.)<br>
							<br>
							
						PUDDY: Hey.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hey, Elaine.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Hey. I think you know Dr... Zaius.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Jerry showcasing his no-wallet look.)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: So, Elaine, notice anything different about my... pants?<br>
							<br>
							
						(Elaine eyeing Jerry patheticall, then turning to George.)<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: So, George... did you get the chair?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: No, I don't have it yet.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: So, we're givin' him nothing?<br>
							<br>
							
						(George pulling out a picture of the chair.)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: No, I brought a picture of the chair.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Did you at least get him a card?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I thought we'd all sign the picture.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Joe Mayo walking up to the gang with an armload of guests' coats.)<br>
							<br>
							
						JOY MAYO: Elaine...<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Hey, Joe Mayo.<br>
							<br>
							
						JOY MAYO: I need you to be in charge of coats.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Elaine being given all the coats and Puddy's fur coat thrown on top.)<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oh, fantastic.<br>
							<br>
							
						JOY MAYO: And Puddy, can you make sure no one puts a drink on my...sound system?<br>
							<br>
							
						PUDDY: Sure thing, Joe Mayo.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Jerry over by the aquarium talking to a girl.)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hi, I'm Jerry. How do you like my pants?<br>
							<br>
							
						KERI: Nice.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (talking to George) It's working. (to the girl, who's tapping on the aquarium) Don't tap on the glass.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (answering the phone while walking away) Joe Mayo's apartment?<br>
							<br>
							
						PUDDY: (standing guard by the stereo as George walks by him) Hey! Cocktail off the speaker.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Putting the coats on a bed, Elaine sees the window, opens it, and throws Puddy's coat out)<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Goodbye, Dr. Zaius.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Silvio with his wife, Kramer, and Newman in Jerry's apartment.]<br>
							<br>
							
						SILVIO: Why are we in Jerry's apartment?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Well, I, uh, I like to think of this as my conference room. Yeah, it has a more formal atmosphere, you know, with the shelves, and the furniture.<br>
							<br>
							
						SILVIO: Make it quick Kramer, my wife and I are about to go bowling.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Oh, well, um, Newman thinks that you, uh, evicted him?<br>
							<br>
							
						SILVIO: I did. I don't like Mr. Newman. He is an agitator.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Look... I've known Newman all my life, in the building, and you're all wrong about him. He's a model tenant. Portly, yes, but smart as a whip.<br>
							<br>
							
						SILVIO: OK, on your word he can stay.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: All right.<br>
							<br>
							
						SILVIO: But... I'm gonna keep my eye on him.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Well, you won't regret it.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer looks up at Newman and he sees him close to kissing Silvio's wife. Silvio, sees the cigar fall right out of Kramer's mouth.<br>
							<br>
							
						SILVIO: What's wrong?<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer hurriedly picks the cigar up, but puts the wrong end in his mouth, burning his tongue, and quickly replacing it the right way in his mouth)<br>
							<br>
							
						JOY MAYO: Elaine, thanks for coming.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Good working with you.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Puddy coming up to them in his fur coat ready to go.)<br>
							<br>
							
						PUDDY: All right, let's hit the bricks.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Elaine sees Puddy still having a coat.)<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: What?<br>
							<br>
							
						JOY MAYO: Hey, I got a coat just like this!<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oh. Uhhh...<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Elaine at Monk's with George and Jerry.]<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: So Joe Mayo had the same coat.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: And you threw it out the window?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Mm-hmm.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: God, you're like a rock star.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: So now Joe Mayo wants me to buy him a new coat.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Because you threw it out.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: No, because I was in charge of the coats. It's... insane.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: But you did actually throw his coat out the window.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: But he doesn't know that. As far as he knows, somebody stole it, and that's the person who should be responsible.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: But that's you.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: So I guess I'll have to buy him a new coat, even though I don't think I should be held responsible, which I am anyway.<br>
							<br>
							
						(George, taking out his wallet to pay the check.)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Well, I'm satisfied. Uh...my back is...killing me.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Of course. Because of that wallet. You-you got a filing cabinet under half of your ass.<br>
							<br>
							
						(George replacing his wallet in his pocket.)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: This...is an organizer, a secretary, and a friend.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Look at you. You're on a slant.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Here, just give me a couple of napkins.<br>
							<br>
							
						(He pulls some napkins out of the dispenser, puts them in his other back pocket, and becomes un-slanted)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: There, there I'm fine.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Suddenly, half of George's body falls with a crunch sound, as he becomes slanty the other way now)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What was that?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I think I had some hard candy in there.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[George sees the delivery man bringing the massage chair into his apartment.]<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: No, no, this is supposed to go to Joe Mayo's apartment.<br>
							<br>
							
						(George sits down in the chair.)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Ahhh. How does this thing work?<br>
							<br>
							
						(George turns the chair on.)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:Ahhhhh...<br>
							<br>
							
						DELIVERY MAN: Sir, do you want me to deliver this to your friend's place or not?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Ahhhhh...<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Keri meeting Jerry on the street. ]<br>
							<br>
							
						KERI: Ready to go?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: All set. I can't believe I'm going dancing.<br>
							<br>
							
						KERI: You don't go that often?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: No, because it's so stupid. Shall we?<br>
							<br>
							
						(Keri handing him a bunch of miscellaneous items that would seem to normally go in her purse.)<br>
							<br>
							
						KERI: Do me a favor. Can you hold this stuff for me?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Compact, lipstick, all this?<br>
							<br>
							
						(Keri, handing him a gigantic ring of keys.)<br>
							<br>
							
						KERI: And can you help to carry my keys?<br>
							<br>
							
						(Jerry looks at the keys.)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What are you, a medieval dungeon master?<br>
							<br>
							
						(Keri, handing him another item as she starts to walk down the street. )<br>
							<br>
							
						KERI: And a tin of altoids.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Jerry puts it all in his pocket and then trying to catch up to her)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Ow! Sharp key.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Kramer walks on the street with Newman]<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: So, you're sleeping with Silvio's wife?<br>
							<br>
							
						NEWMAN: Well, there's very little sleeping going on.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Well, why didn't you tell me about this?<br>
							<br>
							
						NEWMAN: Quite frankly, I don't see how it's any of your business.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Well, it's my business now. Look, I stuck up for you. Man, if he catches you, we're both out.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Newman stops under a tree on the street and looking up into it.)<br>
							<br>
							
						NEWMAN: Hey, what is that up that tree?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Hoooh! Man, that looks like a dead bear.<br>
							<br>
							
						NEWMAN: No, that's a fur coat! Hey, uh, give me a boost.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer boosting Newman into the tree.)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Man, where did you learn to climb trees like that?<br>
							<br>
							
						NEWMAN: The Pacific Northwest.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Elaine with Jerry at his apartment.]<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: So, you had to carry some of Keri's stuff. Big deal.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You don't understand. I went on a successful pocket diet, and I want to keep that weight off.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Elaine making a bowl of cereal.)<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: You know what? We sell this thing at Peterman that would be perfect for you.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Not more of that crap from the Titanic?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: No. No. It's a small men's carryall.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I'm not carrying a purse.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Elaine sits down at the table to eat her cereal.)<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: It's not a purse. It's European.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Jerry sits down with Elaine.)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Oh.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Hey, did George buy Joe Mayo that chair yet?<br>
							<br>
							
						(Jerry dialing his phone.)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I don't know.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: If I'm gettin' him a new fur, I'm not chippin' in on a gift, too.<br>
							<br>
							
						(George answering his phone, while still using the massage chair.)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Yeah?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hey, George, did you get Joe Mayo that chair yet?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Not yet. Oh! Ho ho! God...<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: It's in... transit.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Did he get it?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: No.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Mmm, good. Tell him I'm out.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (hearing Elaine over the phone) What, she's out?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Well, so what? You're gettin' a deal, right? We'll split it three ways.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Allllll right!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What is that noise?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (hangs up the phone) That's my toaster. I got to go. Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You know, sometimes I get the feeling George isn't being completely honest with me.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer enters Jerry's apartment and handing Jerry back his pliers.)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Hey. Oh, uh, yeah. Uh, here are your pliers back....Weak hinge.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Well, I guess I better go and price fur coats.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Oh, go down to 88th Street. They're free.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: What are you talking about?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Well, they're hanging from the trees. You know, Newman found one there yesterday. Man, that guy can climb like a ring-tailed lemur!<br>
							<br>
							
						(Elaine pushing Kramer in her 'get-out!' style.)<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: 88th Street? That's where Joe Mayo lives. That's the coat!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What was that pop sound?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Well, I had some hard candy in there.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Newman enters Elaine's apartment.]<br>
							<br>
							
						NEWMAN: So, to what do I owe this unusual invitation?<br>
							<br>
							
						(Elaine taking his coat and then throwing it on the floor.)<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Come in, come in.<br>
							<br>
							
						NEWMAN: Ahh! This is very much as I imagined it to be. Aside from this rattan piece, which seems oddly out of place.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Please, sit down. Newman, um, I wanted to talk to you about something.<br>
							<br>
							
						NEWMAN: This isn't about my opening your mail?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: What?<br>
							<br>
							
						NEWMAN: Because I don't, never have, anything I read was already open.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Uh, yeah, uh, no. Newman, uh, I heard that you found a fur coat in a tree. And, I believe that it belongs to a friend of mine, and I'd like to give it back to him.<br>
							<br>
							
						NEWMAN: Sorry. Climbers, keepers.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: You know, Newmie. Um, I know how you feel about me, and I have to tell you, I'm quite flattered.<br>
							<br>
							
						NEWMAN: You are?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oh, yeah. I mean, of all the men that I know, you're the only one who's held down a steady job for several years.<br>
							<br>
							
						NEWMAN: Well, it's-it's interesting work, I don't mind it.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Ha ha ha ha.<br>
							<br>
							
						NEWMAN: Don't you have a-a boyfriend? A, uh, burly, athletic type?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Uh, don't worry, he's cool.<br>
							<br>
							
						NEWMAN: Cool?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Very cool. So, what do you say? Can you do this one little favor, Newmie?<br>
							<br>
							
						NEWMAN: Oh, how I've waited for this moment. But alas, my heart belongs to another man's wife, and I have given the coat to her.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: All right, we're done here.<br>
							<br>
							
						NEWMAN: For I am in love with Svetlana, and I don't care if the whole world knows, except for Silvio, who would throw me out of the apartment, where I would be dancing on the sidewalk--<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Thank you, thank you, thank you very much.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Keri putting her things into Jerry's carryal.]<br>
							<br>
							
						KERI: Nice carryall.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: It's European.<br>
							<br>
							
						KERI: Do you still have my lipstick?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Uh, yeah, I think I do. I can never find anything in here. Ah, here it is. So, that Joe Mayo throws the worst parties, doesn't he? So what was your job?<br>
							<br>
							
						KERI: My job was to keep you away from the music.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What, he doesn't like my taste in music?<br>
							<br>
							
						KERI: Guess not.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You should've been there last year. I got jiggy with it!<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Silvio, running up and knocking on Kramer's door.]<br>
							<br>
							
						SILVIO: Kramer! It's Silvio! Open up, I need to talk to you! I can see you through the reverse peephole.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Hey, Silvio!<br>
							<br>
							
						(Silvio holding up a fur coat.)<br>
							<br>
							
						SILVIO: Look at this.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Huh?<br>
							<br>
							
						SILVIO: Svetlana says she find it in the laundry room, but I think it is a gift from that postman agitator. Where is he?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Relax, Silvio.<br>
							<br>
							
						SILVIO: No, that's it. You're both out of the building!<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Oh, come on! Hey, Newman didn't even give her that! No, that's not even a woman's coat. It's a man's!<br>
							<br>
							
						SILVIO: A man's?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Yeah.<br>
							<br>
							
						SILVIO: What kind of a man would wear fur?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Oh, lots of 'em.<br>
							<br>
							
						SILVIO: Would you?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: No.<br>
							<br>
							
						SILVIO: Then who?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: What about Jerry?<br>
							<br>
							
						SILVIO: Jerry?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Yeah, sure, he's a celebrity. Oh, yeah, they wear a lot of furs. They're desperate, insecure people.<br>
							<br>
							
						SILVIO: Yes, you are right. It's all about, me, me, me. Please, look at me! I am so pretty! Love me! Want me!<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Yeah, something like that.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Jerry in his apartment with Kramer.]<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I have to do what?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: All you have to do is wear the fur so Silvio thinks it's yours.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I'm not wearing the fur.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Well, then, Newman and I, we get thrown out of the building.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Is that right?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: All right, why don't you just take a good, hard look at what your life will be like if I'm not around?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Newman, too?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Oh, come on, man! Well, I'll tell you what, if you do this, I'll give you that walkman you're always asking about.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: That's my walkman!<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: And you'll get it back.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: All right.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: All right. Good, thanks, I owe you one.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Hey.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Oh, hey, and by the way, uh, that walkman was broke when you gave it to me.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: George, did you get that chair yet?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: It gets here when it gets here. Would you stop ridin' me?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You know what? Just call up and cancel it. I'm out.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Excuse me?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Joe Mayo doesn't like my taste in music. He's not gettin' a gift from me.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Oh, I can't believe you're dropping out, too. So now Kramer and I have to pay for the entire gift?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Whoa, whoa. Now, who's this Joe Mayo everyone's talking about?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: He's the guy we're the buying the chair for, remember? It was your suggestion.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: I think the chair is a fantastic gift idea. But I never heard of this Joe Mayo. And frankly, it sounds made up.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Oh, so now I have to buy this whole chair by myself?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: No, you don't have to buy anything.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I already bought it! I've been lyin' to you for three days, and now you're all screwin' me!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I don't understand. Why didn't you tell us you had it?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I needed it! My back is... a little tweaked.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Because of your giant wallet. Just get rid of it!<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Never! It is a part of me. I will just return the chair, and it will be easy, because the receipt is in my good friend.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Your good friend is morbidly obese.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Well, at least, I'm not carrying a purse.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: It's not a purse. It's European!<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: All right, Silvio's down there. He's shoveling the walk. Now, all you gotta do is put this on, you go down to the corner, you pick up a paper, and you come right back.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: All right.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer puts the coat on Jerry.)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: There you go.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: How do I look?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Ahh....<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[George pulls down a tab from an ad he sees on the street.]<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Learn guitar, first lesson free? Huh.<br>
							<br>
							
						(George puts the stub of paper in his wallet, and tries to close it, everything inside it flies out as the whole wallet explodes)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: My receipts! The chair! My tiger poster!<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Outside on the Street in front of Jerry's]<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hey, Silvio, just out for a little stroll in my favorite fur coat.<br>
							<br>
							
						SILVIO: That is your coat?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: It sure is.<br>
							<br>
							
						SILVIO: Kramer says you need it because you're an entertainer and you're desperate for attention.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: That's true.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer giving Jerry his carryal.)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Jerry, you forgot your purse.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Oh, thanks.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Hey, Silvio, look at Jerry here, prancing around in his coat with his purse. Yup, he's a dandy. He's a real fancy boy.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Maybe this isn't my coat.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: All right, you're not fancy!<br>
							<br>
							
						SILVIO: No, he's very fancy! Want me, love me! Shower me with kisses!<br>
							<br>
							
						(Elaine, coming up to them on the street.)<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Jerry, where'd you get it? That's his coat.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: No, it's not. It's mine. I'm a fancy boy.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: No, that's not your coat.<br>
							<br>
							
						SILVIO: If that is not his coat, whose coat is it?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: It's Joe Mayo's coat.<br>
							<br>
							
						SILVIO: Who's Joe Mayo?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: That must be the man that's sleeping with your wife.<br>
							<br>
							
						(A pickpocket runs by, taking Jerry's carryall, while everyone yells in surprise)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hey! Officer! Someone took my European carryall!<br>
							<br>
							
						COP:: Your what?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: The...black, leather...thing with a strap.<br>
							<br>
							
						COP:: You mean a purse?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yes, a purse. I carry a purse!<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Jerry, on the phone with Elaine putting his things back into his wallet]<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: So, Silvio ambushed Joe Mayo?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Yeah, he was waitin' inside his apartment for him with a sock full of pennies.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: He should have had a reverse peephole.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Puddy entering Elaine's apartment in a new bright, multi-colored leather coat.)<br>
							<br>
							
						PUDDY: Hey, Babe.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Elaine hangs up the phone to talk to Puddy.)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hello? Hello?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: What is that?<br>
							<br>
							
						PUDDY: It's my new coat.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: You ditched the fur?<br>
							<br>
							
						PUDDY: Yeah, I saw Jerry wearing his. He looked like a bit of a dandy. Check it out! 8-Ball! You got a question, you ask the 8-Ball.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: You're gonna wear this all the time?<br>
							<br>
							
						PUDDY: All signs point to 'Yes!'<br>
