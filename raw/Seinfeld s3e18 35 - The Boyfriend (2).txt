						GEORGE: 129 west 81st street and hurry.<br>
							<br>
							
						(same cabby as part one; stares at him)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Goodbye (exits cab)<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Jerry's Apartment]<br>
							<br>
							
						KEITH: Better bring your gloves, it's freezing out there. It shouldn't take too long. I'd say maybe, oh, four hours. Really though, Jerry, there's not that much. First we got the bedroom, we got two dressers and the bed.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Is there a box spring?<br>
							<br>
							
						KEITH: What's that?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Is there a box spring?<br>
							<br>
							
						KEITH: Yeah there's a box spring but it's attached to the headboard and we'll have to take that apart. Then we got the couch.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Is that a sectional?<br>
							<br>
							
						KEITH: Yeah. Twelve pieces. &lt;not clear&gt; &#133;coffee table.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Is that a thick marble?<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[&#133; Jerry and Keith start to laugh and Jerry walks behind Keith so they don't make eye<br>
							
						contact and break up]<br>
							<br>
							
						KEITH: Three inches thick. Got it in Italy. But the BIG problem is going to be the convertible sofa. You see when you move it it tends to open up so it's going to be real difficult getting it down the stairs.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: STAIRS??? There's no elevator?<br>
							<br>
							
						KEITH: Nah, it's a brownstone. Three floors.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I'm sorry I can't do this. I can't do it. I can't. It, it's too soon. I don't know you. I can't help you move. I'm sorry. I can't. I just can't.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer enters, sees Keith and does a double take)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Hello.<br>
							<br>
							
						KEITH: Hello.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Oh, you don't remember me.<br>
							<br>
							
						KEITH: No should I [continuity error: in fact he SHOULD from the basketball game]<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Yeah, you should. I certainly remember you. Let me refresh your memory.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Newman enters)<br>
							<br>
							
						NEWMAN: June 14th, 1987. Mets Phillies. You made a big error. Cost the Mets the game. Then you're coming up the parking lot ramp.<br>
							<br>
							
						KEITH: YOU said, &quot;Nice game, pretty boy.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Ah, you remember.<br>
							<br>
							
						NEWMAN: And then you spit on us.<br>
							<br>
							
						KEITH: Hey, I didn't spit at you.<br>
							<br>
							
						NEWMAN: Oh, yeah, right.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: No no no, well, then who was it?<br>
							<br>
							
						KEITH: Well lookit, the way I remember it (back to the grainy 8mm film parody) I was walking up the ramp. I was upset about the game. That's when you called me pretty boy. It ticked me off. I started to turn around to say something and as I turned around I saw Roger McDowell behind the bushes over by that gravely road. &#133; Anyway he was talking to someone and they were talking to you. I tried to scream out but it was too late. It was already on its way.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I told you!<br>
							<br>
							
						NEWMAN: Wow, it was McDowell.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: But why? Why McDowell?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Well, maybe because we were sitting in the right field stands cursing at him in the bullpen all game.<br>
							<br>
							
						NEWMAN: He must have caught a glimpse of us when I poured that beer on his head.<br>
							<br>
							
						NEWMAN: It was McDowell.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Oh boy. Uh, look uh, Keith, uh, we're sorry.<br>
							<br>
							
						NEWMAN: Yeah, I couldn't be sorrier. I uh.<br>
							<br>
							
						KEITH: look guys, don't worry about it, I uh, Well I guess I better get going.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Wait, uh what are ya' doing?<br>
							<br>
							
						KEITH: I gotta move.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Want any help?<br>
							<br>
							
						KEITH: I'd love some.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: I'd love to help you move.<br>
							<br>
							
						NEWMAN: Me too.<br>
							<br>
							
						KEITH: Ok guys, we gotta be careful of one thing. Some of the stuff's very fragile We're going to have to handle it like a baby.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: No sweat.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer and Newman exit)<br>
							<br>
							
						(phone rings)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hello, &#133; oh hi Elaine .. what's going on &#133; no he just left &#133; you broke up with him? &#133; ME TOO .. what happened? &#133; oh smoking you know you're like going out with C.

Okay bye.<br>
							<br>
							
						(George frantically enters)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Keith, Keith Wa What happened? Where's Keith?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You just missed him. he just left. What do you need him for?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (out the window) Keith, Keith, up here. Can you do me a favor? I need you to go to the unemployment office with me. I, I'm Jerry's friend &#133; the guy from the locker room, &#133; I'm the chucker. It'll take five minutes. Wait. Wait.<br>
							<br>
							
						(sits down)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Well Biff/ What's next?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I don't know.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Tall girl enters)<br>
							<br>
							
						TALL GIRL: Excuse me. I was walking behind you and you dropped your wallet.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Ending Monologue]<br>

						When You're moving your whole world becomes boxes. That's all you think about is boxes. Boxes, where are there boxes? You just wander down the street going in and out of stores. Are there boxes here? Have you seen any boxes? I mean it's all you think about. You can't even talk to people because you can't concentrate. Shut up I'm looking for boxes. Just after a while you become like really into it you can smell them. You walk into a store. There's boxes here. Don't tell me you don't have boxes. Dammit, I can SMELL them. I'm like I'm obsessed. I love the smell of cardboard in the morning. You could be at a funeral. Everyone's mourning crying around, and your looking at the casket. That's a nice box Does anyone know where that guy got that box? When he's done with it do you think I could get that? it's got some nice handles on it. And that's what death is really. It's the last big move of your life. The hearse is like the van. The pale bearers are your close friends the only ones you could ask to help you with a big move like that. and the casket is that great perfect box you've been waiting for your whole life The only problem is, once you find it you're in it.<br>
