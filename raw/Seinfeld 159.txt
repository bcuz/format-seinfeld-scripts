						[The Costanzas are driving in the car.]<br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: I got no leg room back here. Move your seat forward.<br>
							<br>
							
						ESTELLE: That's as far as it goes.<br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: There's a mechanism. You just pull it, and throw your body weight.<br>
							<br>
							
						ESTELLE: I pulled it. It doesn't go.<br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: If you want the leg room, say you want the leg room! Don't blame the mechanism!<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: All right, Dad, we're five blocks from the house. Sit sideways.<br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: Like an animal. Because of her, I have to sit here like an animal! Serenity now! Serenity now!<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: What is that?<br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: Doctor gave me a relaxation cassette. When my blood pressure gets too high, the man on the tape tells me to say, 'Serenity now!'<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Are you supposed to yell it?<br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: The man on the tape wasn't specific.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: What happened to the screen door? It blew off again?<br>
							<br>
							
						ESTELLE: I told you to fix that thing.<br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: Serenity nowww!<br>
							<br>
							
						&nbsp;<br>
							<br>
							
						[Monk's]<br>
							<br>
							
						PATTY: So I told Bobby and Lisa that we'd try the new Chinese Spanish<br>
							<br>
							
						place La Caridad on Saturday.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Oh, I thought we had tickets for the Knicks home opener.<br>
							<br>
							
						PATTY: Well I thought this would be more fun so I gave the tickets away.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What? All right, fine.<br>
							<br>
							
						PATTY: Are you mad at me?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: No, I love a good Chinese Spanish whatever it is.<br>
							<br>
							
						PATTY: You know... I've never seen you mad.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I get peeved.<br>
							<br>
							
						PATTY: Mad.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Miffed.<br>
							<br>
							
						PATTY: *Mad*.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Irked?<br>
							<br>
							
						PATTY: I'd like to see you get *really* mad.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Why does she want you to be mad?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: She says I suppress my emotions.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: So what do you care what she thinks.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Good body.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: She probably gets that impression because you're cool. You're under control. Like me. Nothing wrong with that.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: But I get upset, I've yelled. You've heard me yell.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Not really. Your voice kind of raises to this comedic pitch. (Kramer enters)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Hey.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Kramer, I am so sick of you comin' in here and eatin' all my food. Now shut that door and get the hell out of here!<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: (Laughing) What is that, a new bit?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I told ya. Hey, any of you guys want to come out and help me fix my father's screen door in Queens?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Sorry, I'm fixing a screen door in the Bronx.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: I'll do it.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Really? You wanna come?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Yeah, I love going to the country.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Where are they goin'?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Fix a screen door in Queens.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: (Laughing) That's funny. Hey, listen, what are you doin' Saturday night?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Not goin' to the Knick game.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I need someone to go with me to Mr. Lippman's son's Bar Mitzvah.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You know, if you don't bring a guest they save a catering. You should be able to buy a cheaper gift.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: (Taking out Boggle) Oh, I don't think that's possible.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: (Holding camera) Get in a little closer. I can't see the screen door. (Takes picture) Perfect.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Dad, the hinges are all rusted here. That's why the wind keeps blowing the door off.<br>
							<br>
							
						ESTELLE: I hate that old door. Throw it out!<br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: Serenity now!<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: It might be time to just let her go, Frank. She's worked hard for ya.<br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: Will you put her to rest for me?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Oh yeah, I'll take good care of her. (Rips out the screen door) &nbsp;<br>
							<br>
							
						ESTELLE: (From other room) Get George to put those boxes in the garage.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Dad, what's all this?<br>
							<br>
							
						ESTELLE: (From other room) It's junk.<br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: My computers. I've been selling them for two months now. Shut up!<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: You're selling computers?<br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: Two months ago, I saw a provocative movie on cable TV. It was called The Net, with that girl from the bus. I did a little reading, and I realize, it wasn't that farfetched.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Dad, you know what it takes to compete with Microsoft and IBM?<br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: Yes, I do. That's why I got a secret weapon... my son.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Damn it, they gave me cream! I asked for nonfat milk!<br>
							<br>
							
						PATTY: I think they have 1% over there.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: 1%?! They can kiss 1% of my ass!<br>
							<br>
							
						PATTY: OK, Jerry, enough. I'm not buying it.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You're damn right you're not buying it!<br>
							<br>
							
						PATTY: You shouldn't have to try. It's just being open.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I'm open. There's just nothing in there.<br>
							<br>
							
						PATTY: Sarcastically) Uh huh.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Oh, you think I'm lying about this?<br>
							<br>
							
						PATTY: I think you are.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Well, I'm not.<br>
							<br>
							
						PATTY: Yes, you are, liar.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Oh, stop it.<br>
							<br>
							
						PATTY: OK, liar.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: That's enough!<br>
							<br>
							
						PATTY: Ooh, that was good.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Really? It felt good.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Congratulations, Mr. Lippman.<br>
							<br>
							
						LIPPMAN: Oh, Elaine. My boy's a man today. Can you believe it? He's a man.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oh, congratulations, Adam. (Adam zealously French-kisses Elaine)<br>
							<br>
							
						ADAM: I'm a man!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Tongue?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Yeah.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Wow! I didn't try that 'til I was 23.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Well this kid's not just a man. He's a man's man.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: And I think he's been telling his friends. I got invitations to six more Bar Mitzvahs. (phone rings)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. No, no, no, I do not want to stop over in Cincinnati. Well, then you upgrade me. That's right, you should thank me. Goodbye. (Hangs up) Hey, I'm flyin' first class.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Where did that come from?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Patty showed me how to get mad. You gotta problem with that?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: No.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Good.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: All right, relax, tough guy. I got to go out to my father's garage, help him sell some computers.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What? The two of you workin' in that garage is like a steel cage death match.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Kramer.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Yeah.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: What-what are you doing?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Oh, I'm putting up Frank's screen door. This beauty's got a little life in her yet.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What do you need it for?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: (Closing door) The cool evening breezes of Anytown, USA. Let's see how this baby closes. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Morning, ma.<br>
							<br>
							
						ESTELLE: (From another room ) You're late!<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Morning, dad.<br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: I'm not 'dad' in the workplace. My professional name is Mr. Costanza, and I will refer to you as 'Costanza'. Morning, Braun.<br>
							<br>
							
						LLOYD: (Handing Frank coffee) Morning, George. Two cream, no sugar.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: What is Lloyd Braun doing here?<br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: Your mother recommended him.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Yeah, of course she did. That's all I ever heard growing up is 'Why can't you be more like Lloyd Braun?' Did you know he was in a mental institution?<br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: I didn't read his resume.<br>
							<br>
							
						LLOYD: (Ringing the sale bell) Another sale, Mr. Costanza. Chalk me up on the big board.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (Inquiring about the chalk board) What is this?<br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: (Drawing a zero under George's name) This is your lagging. Good work, Braun.<br>
							<br>
							
						ESTELLE: (From another room) Good for you, Lloyd!<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: So Adam, I just talked to your father, and, apology accepted.<br>
							<br>
							
						ADAM: I'm not apologizing. It was great. I told everyone.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Yeah, I know. Uh, by the way, could you do me a favor and tell Mitchell Tanenbaum that I will be unable to attend this Saturday.<br>
							<br>
							
						ADAM: Are you free Friday night?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I am, but that is not the point. You are thirteen, and I am in my early... 20s.<br>
							<br>
							
						ADAM: But I'm a man. The rabbi said so.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: No. You are not a man. It takes a *long* time to become a man. I mean, half my friends aren't even there yet.<br>
							<br>
							
						ADAM: Well, if I'm not a man, then this whole thing was a sham! First, they said I was gonna get great gifts, and then, somebody gives me Boggle. I renounce my religion!<br>
							<br>
							
						LIPPMAN: Who wants cookies?<br>
							<br>
							
						ADAM: As of this moment, I am no longer Jewish. I quit!<br>
							<br>
							
						LIPPMAN: What?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: (Eating) Walnuts, mmmmmm. &nbsp;<br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: You're late again, Costanza, so listen up. Starting tonight, we're having a little sales contest. The loser gets fired, the winner gets a Waterpik.<br>
							<br>
							
						ESTELLE: (From another room) You're not giving away our Waterpik!<br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: Serenity now!<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: You know what? It doesn't matter, because I quit!<br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: I guess your mother was right. You never could compete with Lloyd Braun! (Lloyd rings his sale bell and smiles)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: You wanna sell computers? I will show *you* how to sell computers! Hello, Mr. Farneman. You wanna buy a computer? No? Why not? All right, I see! Good answer! Thank you! (Lloyd rings his sale bell) Serenity now!<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Adam, you don't become a man overnight. Look at your father. It takes time. Patience, experience. Uh, several careers of varying success. And these are things I look for in a man.<br>
							<br>
							
						ADAM: (Storming out of the room) Well, that does me a lot of good. 'Early 20s'!<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Well, I'm sorry, sir, I tried.<br>
							<br>
							
						LIPPMAN: So, that's the type of guy you're looking for?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Uhh. I guess so. Why? (Mr. Lippman vigorously starts making out with her)<br>
							<br>
							
						PATTY: (Surveying Kramer's hall patio ) What is this?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (Knocking on Kramer's door) Anytown, U.S.A. Hello? Is Kramer home? Oh, hey.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: (Spraying his flowers) Hello, neighbor.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Boy, those azaleas are really coming in nicely.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Oh, you gotta mulch. You've got to.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You barbecuing tonight?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: (Ringing his wind chimes) Right after the fireworks.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: So, where do you want to eat tonight?<br>
							<br>
							
						PATTY: How about La Caridad again?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Again!? How much flan can a person eat!?<br>
							<br>
							
						PATTY: Jerry, you've been yelling at me all afternoon.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Well, I don't think more flan is the answer!<br>
							<br>
							
						PATTY: Maybe I should just leave.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: 'Maybe'!?<br>
							<br>
							
						PATTY: Good-bye!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Double good-bye! (As Patty leaves, open door reveals Kramer, sitting on his lawn chair with a sparkler)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Hey, buddy!<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: (Coming in Jerry's apartment) Hey. Happy New Year!<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: (Getting the door slammed on him) Y'all come back reeeaall...<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Did you and Patty just break up?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yeah! In fact, she broke up with me! And I don't want to talk about it!<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Well, then you're free tonight. You know what, I heard about this great place called La Caridad.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: That's the last thing she said to me. She wanted to go there also, but I wasn't in the mood.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Whoa. What is the matter?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: It's Patty.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Jerry, you break up with a girl every week.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (Crying) What--what is this salty discharge?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oh my God. You're crying.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: This is horrible! I care!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Patty won't call me back. I don't know if I can live without her.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: She's really gotten to you, hasn't she?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I don't know what's happening to me.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Simple. You let out one emotion, all the rest will come with it. It's like Endora's box.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: That was the mother on Bewitched. You mean Pandora.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Yeah, well, she... had one, too. (George enters)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Jerry, can I talk to you for a second? (They enter Jerry's apartment)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: (Baseball flies at Kramer and hits him) That's it, that's it! I warned you kids. I told you not to play in front of my house. This time, I'm keepin' it. And you're not getting back your rock either!<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (hearing Jerry broke up with Patty) Are you still down in the dumps? Come on. It's just a chick.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You ever heard of a little thing called feelings?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Well, I got just the thing to cheer you up. A computer! Huh? We can check porn, and stock quotes.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Porn quotes... I'm so lucky to have a friend like you, George. Ever tell you how much I love you?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: What?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I love you, George. Come here.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I-I'm already here. I'm here. I'm here. Uh, you know what? If you want a computer, call me. I-I gotta go.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Go wherever you want. I'm still gonna love you.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Jerry's Apartment; Later]<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Look what they did. Look what they did to my house! I turn my back for two seconds, and they put shaving cream all over my door. You, I see you! I'll teach these kids a lesson. Where's that house I put under your sink?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hose under my sink. I love *you*, Kramer!<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: I love you, too, buddy, and George--<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I don't want to hear it, Kramer!<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Listen, when I give you the signal, I want you to turn this water on full blast.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: What signal? What-what signal?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: I'll yell, uh, 'Hoochie mama!'<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: If I do it, will you buy a computer?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: On the signal, George. On the signal.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Only if you buy. I gotta make a sale.<br>

						JERRY: I love you, Costanza.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Will you shut up?!<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Now! Now, George! Turn on the faucet! George, turn on the faucet! Hoochie mama! Hoochie mama! Hoochie mamamaaaaa!<br>
							<br>

						[Cab; Elaine and George]<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: So now the *other* Lippman kissed me.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Well, sure. They're Jewish, and you're a shiksa.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: What?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: It means a non-Jewish woman.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I know what it means, but what does being a shiksa have to do with it?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: You've got 'shiksappeal'. Jewish men love the idea of meeting a woman that's not like their mother.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oh, that's insane.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I'll tell you what's insane: the price that I could get you on a new desktop computer.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I am not buying a computer from you.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: There's porn.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: (Pausing) Even so.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Damn it!<br>
							<br>

						[Lippman's House]<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Don't get me wrong, Mr. Lippman. I-I'm very flattered that you found me attractive enough to... lunge at me. Huh. But the only reason you like me is because I'm a shiksa.<br>
							<br>
							
						LIPPMAN: That's simply not true.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: If you weren't Jewish, you wouldn't be interested in me.<br>
							<br>
							
						LIPPMAN: You are wrong. I'll prove it.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oh, no. Don't!<br>
							<br>
							
						LIPPMAN: I renounce Judaism!<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oy vey!<br>
							<br>

						[Jerry's Apartment]<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What happened to you, pal?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Joey Zanfino and some of the neighborhood kids. They ambushed me with a box of 'Grade A's.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Are you all right?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Oh, no. I'm fine. Serenity now. Serenity now. Serenity now.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: So, you're using Frank's relaxation method?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: (Trying to open a back of chips) Jerry, the anger, it just melts right off. Serenity now. Look at this. Serenity now!<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: (Enters) Hey, what happened to you?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Serenity! (He exits)<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Well. You are not gonna believe this. Now Lippman is renounced. This shiksa thing is *totally* out of control. What is *with* you people? What are you looking at?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Sit down, Elaine.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oh, no. Jerry, I can't take any more gentle sobbing.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I've been thinking about what it means to be complete.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Do you have an apple or anything?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Look at us, hurtling through space on this big, blue marble.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Or a nectarine? I would absolutely love a nectarine.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Looking everywhere for some kind of meaning...<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Why am I in such a fruit mood? Ahh, banana!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: When all the while, the real secret to happiness has been right in front of us!<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: What?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Elaine...<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (Entering Jerry's apartment with a cartload of computers) Jerry, I've found a way to beat Lloyd Braun! I buy the computers myself, I store 'em in your apartment. Then, after I win the contest, I bring 'em all back and get my money back. Ha ha! It's brilliant. What? What's wrong with your leg?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I'm asking Elaine to marry me.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (Leaving) I'll store these over at Kramer's apartment.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Elaine?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Uhh, Jerry, I've got a lot goin' on with, uh, Lippman right now.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Lippman?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: (Trying to get her bag to leave) Yeah, and him too. What?! Oh, yeah! I think George is calling me, so I'm gonna go give him a hand. Come on! Come on!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Can I help you?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: No. Stay! Stay. Stay.<br>
							<br>

						[Costanzas' Garage]<br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: Hey, Braun, Costanza's kicking your butt!<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (using the phone) Watch how it's done. Oh, hello, Mr. Vandelay? Would you like to buy a computer? Oh, really? Two dozen?<br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: Costanza, you're white hot!<br>
							<br>
							
						PHONE: If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and--<br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: Hey, Braun, I got good news and bad news. And they're both the same: you're fired. Costanza, you've won the water pik!<br>
							<br>
							
						ESTELLE: You're not gonna give away that water pik!<br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: You wanna bet? Serenity now, serenity now!<br>
							<br>
							
						LLOYD: You know, you should tell your dad that 'serenity now' thing doesn't work. It just bottles up the anger, and eventually, you blow.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: What do you know? You were in the nut house.<br>
							<br>
							
						LLOYD: What do you think put me there?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I heard they found a family in your freezer<br>
							<br>
							
						LLOYD: Serenity now. Insanity later.<br>
							<br>

						[Hallway in to Jerry's Apartment]<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What happened here, Kramer?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Serenity now, serenity now...<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Kramer!<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Geez! Jerry, I didn't here you come in. Yeah, the children, they've done sum redecorating. Serenity now, serenity now.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You don't look well.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Well, that's odd, 'cause I feel perfectly at peace with the world- uh! eggs! you! Serenity now, serenity now, serenity now.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Oh, I'm sorry. Look at me, I stepped on your last rose.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: (going into his apartment) Jerry, come on. Don't get upset about it. There's always next spring. Now will you excuse me for a moment. Serenity nooooooooww!<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Jerry! I did it! Haha! I beat Braun!<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: (crashing and banging in his apartment) Serenity now!<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Come on, wanna give me a hand with the computers?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: (Crashing and banging around) Serenity nooooowwwww!<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Jerry's Apartment]<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Why couldn't you squeeze one of those stupid rubber balls to get your stress out? Why did you have to destroy *twenty-five* computers?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: (Leaving) George, you listen to me. I owe ya one.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: He's incorrigible. You want to talk about it?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Oh, please don't tell me you love me again, Jerry, I can't handle it.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: George, letting my emotions out was the best thing I've ever done. Sure I'm not funny anymore, but there's more to life than making shallow, fairly-obvious observations. How about you?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: All right... here goes...<br>
							<br>
							
						&nbsp;<br>
							<br>
							
						[Rabbi's Office]<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Rabbi, is there anything I can do to combat this Shiks-appeal?<br>
							<br>
							
						RABBI: Ha! Elaine, shiks-appeal is a myth, like the Yeti, or his North American cousin, the Sasquatch.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Well, something's goin' on here, 'cause every able-bodied Israelite in the county is driving pretty strong to the hoop.<br>
							<br>
							
						RABBI: Elaine, there's much you don't understand about the Jewish religion. For example, did you know that rabbis are allowed to date?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: (About to leave) Well, what does that have to do...?<br>
							<br>
							
						RABBI: You know, a member of my congregation has a timeshare in Myrtle Beach. Perhaps, if you're not too busy, we could wing on down after the High Holidays? Elaine? 'Lainie?<br>
							<br>
							
						&nbsp;<br>
							<br>
							
						[Jerry's Apartment]<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: So, that's it. All of my darkest fears, and... everything I'm capable of. That's me.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yikes. Well, good look with all that.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Where you going? I-I thought I could count on you for a little compassion.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I think you scared me straight.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: All right, Jerome, I'm in.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Maybe we should get married. Maybe everything we need is right here in front of us. Jer... let's do it.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I tell ya, I don't see it happening.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: What? What happened to the new Jerry?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: He doesn't work here anymore.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oh, well that's just *great!*<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I love you, Jerry.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (Leaving) Right back at ya, Slick.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: You know, all these years, I've always wanted to see the two of you get back together.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Well, that's because you're an idiot.<br>
							<br>
							
						&nbsp;<br>
							<br>
							
						[Costanzas' Garage]<br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: You single-handedly brought Costanza and Son to the brink of bankruptcy.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Well what about all the Lloyd Braun sales?<br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: He's crazy. His phone wasn't even hooked up. He just liked ringing that bell.<br>
							<br>
							
						ESTELLE: I told you to clean out this garage. I have to put my car in!<br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: This is a place of business. I told you never to come in here. Serenity now!<br>
							<br>
							
						ESTELLE: All right...<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Dad, you really should lay off the 'serenity now' stuff.<br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: So, what am I supposed to say?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: 'Hoochie mama'?<br>
							<br>
							
						ESTELLE: Move your crap, I'm comin' in!<br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: No you're not! Hoochie mama! Hoochie mama!<br>
