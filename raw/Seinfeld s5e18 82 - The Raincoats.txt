						[Opening Monologue]<br>
							<br>
							
						I really feel as human beings, we need more training in our basic social skills. Conversational Distance, don't you hate these people that talk to you they talk into your mouth like you're a clown at a drive-through and Hand shakes is the worst, there's absolutely no guidelines for hand shakes you know these people? Too long, too weak, sometimes they give you the three-quarter handshake just the fingers, early release, late release, sometimes people will dispute your release, you let go there're hangin' on. I have actually said to people 'Hey the handshake is over!.' Too many pumps, coming in too high, too sweaty, coming from too far away. Sometimes a guy will give you a strong grip, late release, and pull you in for the too close conversation. To him I say 'That's three strikes you're out.'<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Monk's]<br>
							<br>
							
						(George and Jerry at the usual booth)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You know their timing couldn't be worse.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Is there ever a good time to have your parents stay with you?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You don't understand, I haven't been together with Rachel for like three weeks. First I was on the road, then my parents show up, I'm getting a little uh backed up.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: When are they leaving for Paris?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Not for another three days.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: What about her place?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: She lives with her parents.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Really? (Jerry shakes his head) Maybe this will become like a cool thing, living with your parents.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (sarcastically) Ya, then maybe baldness will catch on. This will all be turning your way.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Hey believe me, baldness will catch on. When the aliens come, who do you think they're gonna relate to? Who do you think is going to be the first ones getting a tour of the ship?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: The baldies<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Hey by the way my parents really want to have your parents over dinner before they leave town.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: That's good, then I get the apartment for at least one night. You know I'm paying for this whole Paris trip it's their anniversary present.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Alec and Joey enter)<br>
							<br>
							
						ALEC: (walking over to Jerry and George's table) Hey guys.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Hey Alec<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hey Alec<br>
							<br>
							
						ALEC: This is Joey.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Hey Joey, how you doin'?<br>
							<br>
							
						ALEC: (Joey was about to talk) Hey listen, I was wondering if either one of you guys would be interested in doing some work for the Big Brother program? I'm kinda running the local chapter. What do you say George?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Well uh....<br>
							<br>
							
						JOEY: (interrupts) Wouldn't you like to be a big brother to someone like me? Please?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Well, sure Joey, sure, I would be thrilled.<br>
							<br>
							
						ALEC: That's great George, thanks a lot I'll get in touch with you.<br>
							<br>
							
						JOEY: Wouldn't you like to be a big brother..<br>
							<br>
							
						ALEC: (grabs Joey to stop him) Ya alright Joey that's enough, let's go (walking over to the counter) See ya.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What happened?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: What could I do? Did you see the mug on that kid?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (acting like Joey) Wouldn't you like to pass the ketchup to someone like me? Please?<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Street]<br>
							<br>
							
						(Jerry and George walking down the sidewalk.)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hey did you notice they moved where they do the interview on Jeopardy now?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Ya it used to be right in the middle of single Jeopardy and now they do it right after single Jeopardy.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Ya, it's much better isn't it?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Oh, n-no comparison.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hey, I gotta stop off at the bookstore to pick up my parents one of those French-English dictionaries.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (stops Jerry realizing something) Hey hey hey hey hey hey.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Your parents are going to Paris right?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yea?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: So I tell Alec that I have to go to Paris for an undetermined amount of time. Then all I have to do is buy some post cards and have your parents mail them from Paris.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What about little Joey?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Who?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Ah, I think he's probably better off.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Jerry's Apartment]<br>
							<br>
							
						(Morty and Helen are sitting at Jerry's Table; Jerry and George are standing by them)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I'm trying to get out of this Big Brother program. So when you get to Paris (handing Morty the postcards) all you have to do is drop 'em in any mailbox.<br>
							<br>
							
						MORTY: But there are no stamps on these.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Well no not yet, you gotta buy french stamps (pauses) I-I'll reimburse you of course.<br>
							<br>
							
						HELEN: Why are you doing this?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: He wants this guy to think he's in Paris.<br>
							<br>
							
						HELEN: Why?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Because George is a deeply disturbed individual.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer enters)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Oh hey, Helen uh, Could I uh, use some more of your hand lotion?<br>
							<br>
							
						HELEN: I told you it was good. (hands Kramer the lotion)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: (putting on the lotion) Ya<br>
							<br>
							
						HELEN: It's from the Saks Fifth Avenue in Miami.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Mmm (smelling the lotion as he rubs it in) I'm gonna remember that if I'm ever in Florida.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Ya, or if you're ever on Fifth Avenue here in New York City, you could get some there.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Ya<br>
							<br>
							
						MORTY: Say those are some nice pants. I got a pair just like them at home.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Well uh that doesn't surprise me, ya i bought these at Rudy's. It's a used clothing store. See when people like you die, the widows they bring in their wardrobes, they make a bundle.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Really? My father has a ton of old clothes just sitting up in the attic, y-you think they're worth something?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Ya if they're vintage, and you're a widow.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: What happens if the husband dies after the wife, who brings in the clothing in then?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Well I suppose the children do.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (pondering) Yes I suppose they do.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: (takes another smell of his hands) Alright I gotta a ten o'clock, I'll see everybody later.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer goes to turn the door knob and falls straight to the floor slipping off the knob, then continues to try to open the door with no one really watching; He then uses his coat to get a grip and then smiles and exits)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (grabbing his jacket) Hey oo, I just remembered uh my parents really wanna have you guys over for dinner before you leave town. What about tonight?<br>
							<br>
							
						(Morty and Helen look at each other)<br>
							<br>
							
						HELEN: Tonight?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Yea they're making Paella.<br>
							<br>
							
						HELEN: (looking at Morty) Uh oh I don't think we think we can make it tonight, (turns toward George) we have plans.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (watching the whole conversation from his desk) What plans?<br>
							<br>
							
						HELEN: (turns to Jerry) We have plans.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Where'd you get plans?<br>
							<br>
							
						HELEN: (annoyed) We have plans.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Well um, what about tomorrow night?<br>
							<br>
							
						HELEN: (turns back toward George) Maybe<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Ok uh, I guess I'll tell them that.<br>
							<br>
							
						MORTY: (to George as he is about to leave) Hey give 'em our best though.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (quietly) Ya.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (walking over toward George and the door) I'll call you later.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Ya.<br>
							<br>
							
						(George tries to open the door hand slips then he exits; Jerry makes sure the door is closed)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: So what plans do you have?<br>
							<br>
							
						MORTY: None<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: So how come you're not going over there for dinner?<br>
							<br>
							
						HELEN: Jerry we don't care much for the Costanzas'.<br>
							<br>
							
						MORTY: We can't stand them.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Really? Since when?<br>
							<br>
							
						HELEN: Since always. We've never liked them.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Why?<br>
							<br>
							
						HELEN: Well they're so loud, they're always fighting it's uncomfortable, you never notice?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: No I notice but they're from your age group I didn't know you could detect abnormal behavior among your own kind.<br>
							<br>
							
						MORTY: Well we do.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Buzzer; Jerry goes over to answer it)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Ya?<br>

							<br>
							
						ELAINE: It's us.<br>

							<br>
							
						JERRY: I don't know.<br>

							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Have you ever heard of anyone doing anything like this?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Wait a second, he just did me a big favor.<br>

						MORTY: (noticing Kramer's coat) Look at that, Helen do you see what he's wearing? That's the Executive.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Now what is Executive?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: The belt-less trench coat. My father invented it.<br>
							<br>
							
						MORTY: I sure did. Raincoats were my business. The Executive was a classic, these haven't been made in twenty years.<br>
							<br>
							
						HELEN: Why would they? Know body bought them then.<br>
							<br>
							
						MORTY: He's wearing one.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Yea these are a hot item over at Rudy's.<br>
							<br>
							
						MORTY: You don't say? You know I have boxes of those sitting in my garage in Florida?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Get 'em up here. You give me twenty-five percent I-I'll take care of everything.<br>
							<br>
							
						MORTY: You gotta deal.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer and Morty shake hands)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Yaaaa.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: This is like the meeting of Smith and Wesson.<br>
							<br>
							
						MORTY: I'll call Jack Klompus, he's got a key to the garage. He can send them overnight delivery.<br>
							<br>
							
						HELEN: You're gonna first start shipping boxes? We're leaving for Paris in three days.<br>
							<br>
							
						MORTY: He'll send them express.<br>
							<br>
							
						HELEN: You're crazy.<br>
							<br>
							
						MORTY: I'll tell you how crazy I am, I'm gonna pay for this whole trip with these coats.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: N-na I'm paying for the trip.<br>

							<br>
							
						ALEC: Paris huh?<br>

						GEORGE: An apartment complex, the uh the Eiffel Towers. uumm Like I said uh you'll be getting a postcard uh in a few days and again I'm sorry.<br>
							<br>
							
						ALEC: George, you have no idea how fantastic this is.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Fantastic?<br>
							<br>
							
						ALEC: Ya, we've been trying to reunite Joey with his father who lives in Paris. But he's afraid to fly alone, you know he's kinda withdrawn, but he seems to take to you. (George smiling in surprise) So it's a perfect solution.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: How gee what a coincidence.<br>
							<br>
							
						ALEC: And you'll send me a postcard.<br>

						[Elaine's Apartment]<br>

						(Elaine and Aaron lying in bed)<br>
							<br>
							
						AARON: Helen really seemed to respond to Renoir. I think she really connected to the way he painted children.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Mm hmm.<br>
							<br>
							
						AARON: And that Morty, I'll tell ya that guy is full of life. (laughs) He was convinced Monet was near sighted. I kept telling him<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Aaron<br>
							<br>
							
						AARON: Yes?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Uh, let me ask you a question. How come you asked Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld to go to the museum with you?<br>
							<br>
							
						AARON: Well, they were in from out of town, I thought they would enjoy it.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Uhuh, um you didn't feel uncomfortable spending the whole day at the museum with two complete strangers who were more than twice your age?<br>
							<br>
							
						AARON: No, it was fun.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: You had fun with Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld.<br>
							<br>
							
						AARON: Yea, they bought me a coke.<br>

						(Morty and Jerry are sitting at his table; Kramer is standing next to Morty; Helen is getting the fold out sofa ready to sleep)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: So how'd you come up with the idea for the belt-less trench coat?<br>
							<br>
							
						MORTY: I came home one night, and I tripped over one of Jerry's toys. (Jerry smiling points to himself and nods with cards in his hands) So I took out my belt just to threaten him, and I got a glimpse of myself in the mirror.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: How serendipitous.<br>
							<br>
							
						MORTY: So that night I cut off the loops and the Executive was born.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Mmm<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: He also came up with an idea for a brimless rain-hat but that never materialized. (to Morty) Alright come on let's play.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Did you call Jack Klompus yet?<br>
							<br>
							
						MORTY: I haven't been able to reach him. Hey I'll call him right now.<br>

						JACK: What boxes?<br>
							<br>
							
						MORTY: I'm gonna explain what boxes.<br>
							<br>
							
						JACK: Alright how the hell do I know?<br>
							<br>
							
						MORTY: Anyway there are these three big boxes, you can't miss them. I want you to ship them here to New York for me.<br>
							<br>
							
						JACK: I thought you're going to Paris<br>
							<br>
							
						MORTY: I'm still going to Paris. I got a big deal cooking here.<br>
							<br>
							
						JACK: What's in the boxes?<br>
							<br>
							
						MORTY: Raincoats.<br>
							<br>
							
						JACK: Raincoats? (Doris sighs) You think you're gonna sell those old crappy raincoats? That's garbage.<br>
							<br>
							
						HELEN: I guarantee you Doris is not letting him mail those boxes.<br>
							<br>
							
						JACK: When do you want these?<br>
							<br>

							<br>
							
						ESTELLE: Well they better come, I got all this Paella.<br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: I admire Morty and Helen going to France. We should take a trip, maybe a cruise.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Yes a cruise, a long cruise, just the two of you.<br>
							<br>
							
						ESTELLE: Georgie what were you doing poking around the attic last night?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I-I wasn't in the attic.<br>
							<br>
							
						ESTELLE: I heard noise.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Maybe it was a mouse.<br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: (jumping to his feet) OK that's it! We're moving!<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: What?<br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: I will not tolerate infestation.<br>

							<br>
							
						RUDY: Uh huh.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: They will get a good home won't they?<br>
							<br>
							
						RUDY: Look I gotta be honest with you there's nothing here too spectacular.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Oh I beg to differ. My father took great pride in his appearance, he was a very handsome man, a casanova really.<br>
							<br>
							
						RUDY: I'll give you uh two-hundred dollars for the three boxes.<br>

						KRAMER: Yea, last night.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Was this something you had planned for a while?<br>
							<br>

						KRAMER: Ya, you have any others?<br>
							<br>
							
						RUDY: I wish, they don't make 'em anymore.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Suppose I told you I had fifty in mint condition, would you be interested?<br>
							<br>
							
						RUDY: Very interested<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Cuz they're coming in from Florida as we speak.<br>
							<br>
							
						RUDY: Well bring 'em in.<br>

						KRAMER: So you'll buy them?<br>

							<br>
							
						JERRY: What are you talking about?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Mom and Pop Seinfeld<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Look I don't know.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Alright I happen to know what they did last night, they had dinner with Kramer.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Oh they were tired it was a last minute thing.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: So what's the deal they don't want to have dinner with my parents?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: That's right.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Is there something wrong with my parents?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Absolutely<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Because my parents happen to be two pretty wonderful people.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: These the people you currently live with?<br>

						GEORGE: So are they coming tonight or not?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Look I really don't know what they're plans are.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Ok, fine. It's going to be very interesting, very interesting if they don't show up tonight. You know my mother made all this Paella.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What is that anyway?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: It's a spanish dish. It's a moulage of fish, an meat with rice. Very tasty.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I-I'll tell 'em<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Hey could you do one other thing for me?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Name it.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: You think your parents would have any objections to taking a little kid to Paris with them? (Jerry looks at him confused) It turns out that the kid's father lives in Paris. (chuckling) Is that a coincidence? (Jerry smilies) Eh you know Alec wants me to take him over there so I figure as long as they're going (claps)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: So you thought as long as they're mailing postcards, it wouldn't be too much to ask my parents to drag a child who they've never seen, through the streets of Paris?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (pause) Alright if you think it's too much they don't have to mail the postcards.<br>

							<br>
							
						FRANK: What are they too good for us? A raincoat salesman, I could buy and sell 'em like that.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Frank leaves the kitchen and moves into the living room)<br>

						GEORGE: (claps all happy) AH! (half hugs Estelle)<br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: But I can't find any vacation clothes. They were in the attic.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: The attic? Y-you haven't wore any of those clothes for years.<br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: How can I go on a cruise with out my cabana wear? I love those, those clothes. (Looks down yells) AH! (jumps out of his chair) A mouse! I saw a mouse! (takes off into another room with glass doors on it and shuts the door)<br>
							<br>

						I-I-I'm not crazy about used clothes. I mean they call it vintage, you know to take your mind off of what it really is 'nasty wear.' Oh it's clean you know people wear underwear, ya well they don't wear iron underwear and that's what it's gonna take to get me in those clothes. I mean I'll move into an apartment after a strange person moves out, why would I wanna move into somebody's pants? There is no vintage underwear of course, but it's not because the guy couldn't sell his underwear, it's because men wear their underwear until it absolutely disintegrates. Men hang on to underwear until, until each individual underwear molecule is so strained it can barely retain the properties of a solid. It actually becomes underwear vapor. W-we don't even throw it out, we just open a window and it goes out like dandelion spoors. That's how men throw out underwear we just go (blows on the mic) and it's gone that it is jus.<br>

							<br>
							
						HELEN: Well he told you about the place.<br>
							<br>
							
						MORTY: So what, why is that worth twenty-five percent? It's a finders fee. You know what a finders fee is?<br>
							<br>
							
						HELEN: You find something you get a fee.<br>

							<br>
							
						JERRY: It is a tad askew.<br>
							<br>

						JERRY: I've hardly been out to dinner with them.<br>

							<br>
							
						RUDY: Ya how do I know there aren't moths like his stuff?<br>
							<br>
							
						FRANK: My clothes don't have moths!<br>
							<br>
							
						MORTY: Because of his moths you're not buying my raincoats?<br>

						AARON: (turning toward her) No, I could've called the travel agency, got them on another flight to Paris, I coulda got them out.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You tried Aaron, it was too expensive.<br>
							<br>
							
						AARON: (holds his arm up) This watch, this watch could've paid for their whole trip. (holds his other hand up) This ring, this ring is one more dinner I could've taken them out to. (Jerry and Elaine look at each other like he's crazy) Water, they need some water (turns around and runs to the Flight Agent)<br>

						JERRY: Hi Mr. Goldstein is Rachel home?<br>
							<br>
							
						MR. GOLDSTEIN: I'm afraid Rachel's not going to be able to see you tonight, or any other night for that matter.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Why what did I do?<br>
							<br>
							
						MR. GOLDSTEIN: (Rachel is know seen behind her Dad) You know very well. I heard about your behavior at the movies the other night it was disgraceful. You should be ashamed of yourself, I for one will not allow my daughter to be involved with someone of such weak moral fiber. Fortunately my postman happened to have witnessed the entire incident. A heavy set fellow, I believe he lives in your building. (Jerry turns to almost do a 'Newman') Now if you don't mind. (starts to close the door)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Rachel!<br>
							<br>

							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Aahh, (pushes Jerry from her seat at the table) Get Out! How did it happen?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: The broken window, Klompus never fixed it. They just walked right in.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oohh, boy. They could use a vacation.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yea they're taking one, the travel agent is trying to set something else up for them.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: (sighs) So how about that Aaron?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Whew<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: You know what drove me crazy about him? Did you ever notice that he stood too close to you when he talked?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: No I hadn't noticed.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Newman enters and walks by the table; Jerry doesn't notice him as he is getting something out of his coat pocket)<br>
							<br>
							
						NEWMAN: (at the counter) Pair of bear claws please.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (hearing Newman turns and sees him) Hiya Newman.<br>
							<br>
							
						NEWMAN: (moving away from the counter getting closer to the door) Hello Jerry.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Say, I happened to catch you coming out of Schindler's List the other night.<br>
							<br>
							
						NEWMAN: Ohh, were you there?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yes I was.<br>
							<br>
							
						NEWMAN: (looking scared) I-it's a it's a...powerful film.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yes, shocking brutality don't you think?<br>
							<br>
							
						NEWMAN: (couple quick breaths) Shocking.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yes, well that was nothing.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Newman makes a noise and takes off toward the door as Jerry gets up)<br>
							<br>
							
						NEWMAN: (running out the door) Jerry! Jerry!<br>
							<br>
							
						(Jerry chases Newman right out the door)<br>

						[Closing Monologue]<br>
							<br>
							
						Personal distance is a very important thing. There's a new personal distance, ATM distance. When someone's using an ATM, you wanna be about six feet back don't you? Because people a little edgy around that ATM don't they? They got their money out, their eyes are darting all around. The other place I wanna be about six feet away is Urinals, you want some distance there too. ATMs and Urinals, I guess whenever someone's taking valuable out of their pants you want to give them as much room as possible.</td>
