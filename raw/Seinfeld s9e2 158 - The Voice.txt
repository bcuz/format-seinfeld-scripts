						[Scene: In the Play Now office]<br>
							<br>
							
						THOMASSOULO: George, you&#146;re not really handicapped, are you?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I&#146;ve had my difficulties.<br>
							<br>
							
						THOMASSOULO: I saw you running down Amsterdam Avenue lifting that 200 pound motorized cart with one hand.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Mr. Thomassoulo during times of great stress, people are capable of super human strength. Have you ever seen the Incredible Hulk, sir?<br>
							<br>
							
						THOMASSOULO: No<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: How about the old Spider Man live action show?<br>
							<br>
							
						THOMASSOULO: George, I&#146;ve realized we&#146;ve signed a one-year contract with you, but at this point I think it&#146;s best that we both go our separate ways.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I don&#146;t understand.<br>
							<br>
							
						THOMASSOULO: We don&#146;t like you. We want you to leave.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Clearer<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Scene: At Monks Caf&eacute;]<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: So you&#146;re staying at Play Now?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Why not? Pay is good. I got dental, private access to one of the great handicapped toilets in the city.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: But they not you aren&#146;t handicapped, aren&#146;t you ashamed?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: They&#146;re the ones who should be ashamed. They signed me to a one-year contract. As long as I show up for work every day, they have to pay me.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Elaine walks in)<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Hey<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY &amp; GEORGE: (doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o!<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Hello-o-o-o Elaine!<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: What&#146;s that?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Oh, it&#146;s just this stupid thing.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Well, I&#146;m sure it&#146;s stupid. It&#146;s not about me, is it?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (doing the voice) No-o-o-o.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (doing the voice) Not at all.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Tell me!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: All right. You know this girl Clare I am seeing?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Yeah.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Well, he and I starting joking that when she falls asleep her stomach stays awake all night and talks to me.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: How is it talking?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Well, her belly button is like a mouth. (doing the voice) I&#146;m bored. Talk to me.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oh I gotta start taking these &quot;stupid&quot; warnings more seriously.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Puddy walks in)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hey, look whose here - Puddy.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: My Puddy? But we broke up.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: And yet he continues to live.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Puddy walks over to the table)<br>
							<br>
							
						PUDDY: Hey Benes, How are you?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I&#146;m doing great.<br>
							<br>
							
						PUDDY: Great. (pauses) See ya.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Well, that&#146;s it. You two are back together.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: What?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: The bump into. The bump into always leads to the backslide.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: David and I will not be getting back together.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Elaine, breaking up is like knocking over a coke machine. You can&#146;t do it in one push, you got to rock it back and forth a few times, and then it goes over.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: That&#146;s beautiful.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: What about you? You were even engaged, and you cut it off just like that.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: That&#146;s different. I didn&#146;t have feelings for those people. But you, you&#146;ll backslide<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: You want to bet?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Stakes?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: 50<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Dollars?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: All right. Witness? (looks at George).<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Witness.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Done.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Percentage?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY &amp; ELAINE: No.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Scene: At Jerry&#146;s apartment]<br>
							<br>
							
						CLARE: So I&#146;ll call you tonight?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yeah.<br>
							<br>
							
						CLARE: What&#146;s wrong with the belt?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I went to the movies last night, I went to the bathroom and I unbuckled a little wobbly and the buckle kind of banged against the side of the urinal. So&#133;(throws away belt) that&#146;s it!<br>
							<br>
							
						CLARE: So, you&#146;re insane?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Oh yes, quite.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer walks in)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Hello!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Of course it&#146;s a sliding scale.<br>
							<br>
							
						CLARE: Catch you later.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER &amp; JERRY: (doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o! (haha)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (doing the voice) La la la.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: (doing the voice) La la la.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer is reading the newspaper at the table)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Look at this, they are redoing the Cloud Club.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Oh, that restaurant on top of the Chrysler building? Yeah, that&#146;s a good idea.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Of course it&#146;s a good idea, it&#146;s my idea. I conceived this whole project two years ago.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Which part? The renovating the restaurant you don&#146;t own part or spending the two hundred million you don&#146;t have part?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: You see I come up with these things, I know they&#146;re gold, but nothing happens. You know why?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: No resources, no skill, no talent, no ability, no brains.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: (interrupts) No, no&#133;time! It&#146;s all this meaningless time. Laundry, grocery, shopping, coming in here talking to you. Do you have any idea how much time I waste in this apartment?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I can ball park it.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Elaine walks in &#150; how did she come up without the buzzer?)<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: (doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o!<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Here we go; now she comes in. Now my whole day is shot!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hey, I called you last night, where were you?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: (looking VERY guilty) I went out with a (fake cough) a friend.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: George?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: (looking guiltier) No, no&#133;no.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Well, I was here, that&#146;s everyone (laughing).<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: (laughing).<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Are those the same shoes as yesterday?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oh, you know I wear these shoes all the time.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Your hair, it&#146;s somewhat de-poofed.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: It&#146;s the new look. You know Heroin Cheek?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Wait a second, what&#146;s going on here?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Nothing, nothing.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (screams).<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: (screams).<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You&#146;re wearing the same clothes as yesterday!!! (pauses) You saw Puddy!<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Hoochie moochie. (haha)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hand it over. Pay up.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: No! It&#146;s an isolated, sexual incident. We are not back together!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Then what do you call it? People don&#146;t just bump into each other and have sex. This isn&#146;t cinemax.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: It was no big deal OK? I mean we fooled around, then we went out and grabbed a little dinner.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Ah, dinner! That&#146;s it, you&#146;re all the way back!<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Ugh!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Sex, that&#146;s meaningless, I can understand that, but dinner; that&#146;s heavy. That&#146;s like an hour.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: (still reading the paper) Man, 2.9 percent financing on a Toyota Onedun (Sp?). That was my idea too!<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Scene: At Play Now]<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Good Morning!<br>
							<br>
							
						CO-WORKER: Go to hell!<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Hi Allison, that&#146;s a nice dress.<br>
							<br>
							
						ALLISON: Don&#146;t even look at me.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Hey Glenn!<br>
							<br>
							
						GLENN: Hey, go tell hell!<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Heard that one already.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Scene: At Jerry&#146;s apartment]<br>
							<br>
							
						(Jerry walks in. Kramer is showing his &quot;intern,&quot; Darren around)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: &#133;So that&#146;s the bedroom. Here&#146;s the bathroom. If you need to, you can familiarize yourself with the kitchen&#133;Yeah, go ahead and look through some of the drawers.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: And you are?<br>
							<br>
							
						DARREN: Oh, hey, I&#146;m Darren. I&#146;m new here.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Yeah, that&#146;s Jerry, you don&#146;t have to worry about him. Why don&#146;t you go across the hall and get started on that mail.<br>
							<br>
							
						DARREN: Right!<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: He&#146;s a go getter!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Who&#146;s he?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: My intern from NYU. Well, you remember my corporation, Kramerica Industries.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Alright.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Well, apparently NYU is very enthusiastic about their students getting some real world corporate experience.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: But you only provide fantasy world corporate experience.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Well, this will really free up my time so I can focus on more important things, like my bladder system.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Alright, it&#146;s time to go.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Jerry, it&#146;s not for people, it&#146;s for oil tankers.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (sarcastically) I know!<br>
							<br>
							
						(Jerry tries to shove Kramer out the door)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: You see the idea is for a rubber ball inside the tanker so if it crashes, the oil won&#146;t spill out.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Actually, that is not a bad idea.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: (smiles) yeah.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Now, it&#146;s time to go.<br>
							<br>
							
						(slams door)<br>
							<br>
							
						(phone rings)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hello<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o. (He&#146;s sitting on the floor in his Play Now office).<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o. (pauses) So, what&#146;s going on?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Siege mentality, Jerry. They really want me out of here. They&#146;ve downgraded me to some sort of a bunker. I&#146;m like Hitler&#146;s last days here.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: So, are you going to leave?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Oh no! I&#146;m vigilant. They&#146;ll never get me out. I&#146;m like a weed, Jerry.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I thought you&#146;re like Hitler in the bunker?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I&#146;m a weed in Hitler&#146;s bunker.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I&#146;m getting a little uncomfortable with the Hitler stuff. (his other line beeps) I&#146;m getting another call, see ya&#133;(answers call) Hello!<br>
							<br>
							
						DARREN: Hi, this is Darren from Kramer&#146;s office. Mr. Kramer would like to schedule a lunch with you at Monk&#146;s coffee shop.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (looking shocked) Really? When?<br>
							<br>
							
						DARREN: In 10 minutes. Do you need directions?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: No, I don&#146;t.<br>
							<br>
							
						DARREN: Well, I&#146;ll call back in 5 minutes to confirm.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Yeah, 5.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Elaine walks in &#150; again, how did she get up without the buzzer?)<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Hey!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hey! So, where&#146;s my money?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: No money, I am Puddy free. So, are we eating or what?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Oh yeah, hold on.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Jerry calls Kramer and Darren answers)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hello Darren, this is Jerry from Jerry&#146;s office. (Elaine is looking confused). We&#146;re going to be three for lunch. (Elaine is still looking confused) What do you mean he&#146;s already left?<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer walks in)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hey, Elaine is going to come with us, alright?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: What? When did this happen?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Well, just&#133;<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: (yelling) DARREN!<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Scene: At Elaine&#146;s apartment]<br>
							<br>
							
						(Sitting on the couch thinking to herself)<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I am not calling Puddy. What did I do with my gloves? Oh, I bet I left them over at Puddy&#146;s. I should call him. I need those gloves. No, I better not. I&#146;ll call. (looks at table) Oh, look at that! There are the gloves. I was just about to call. There they are. That&#146;s funny. That&#146;s really funny. That&#146;s really really funny. You know who loves funny stories, David Puddy. (Picks up phone).<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Scene: At Monk&#146;s Cafe]<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Well, Play Now is through playing. They turned the heat way up in my office. They tried to sweat me out.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Do you have to write all this stuff down.<br>
							<br>
							
						DARREN: Well, Mr. Kramer is in a meeting with Mr. Lohmase and he didn&#146;t want to miss anything.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: So, how hot did it get?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I don&#146;t know, 120, 130&#133;Then they sent some guys to sandblast for 6 hours. Tomorrow they are putting in asbestos.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I guess you can take anything, but actual work.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Bring it on!<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer walks in)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o Kramer!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (doing the voice) Wel-l-l-c-o-m-e!<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (doing the voice) La la la.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Sorry I couldn&#146;t get out of there, what did I miss? (asking his &quot;intern&quot;)<br>
							<br>
							
						DARREN: Well, after ordering, Mr. Seinfeld and Mr. Costanza debated on whether or not iron man wore some sort under garment between his skin and his iron suit&#133;<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Uh huh&#133;<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (Interrupts) And I still say he&#146;s naked under there!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Oh that makes a lot of sense.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Oh, shut up!<br>
							<br>
							
						DARREN: &#133;Then Mr. Seinfeld went to the restroom, at which point Mr. Costanza scooped ice out of Mr. Seinfeld&#146;s drink with his bare hands using it to wash up (Jerry is taking a sip of water and looking mad) then Mr. Costanza remarked to me, &quot;This never happened.&quot; (Jerry then spits out the water).<br>
							<br>
							
						(George is looking pissed off)<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Scene: At Jerry&#146;s apartment in his bed]<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (giggling)<br>
							<br>
							
						CLARE: What&#146;s so funny?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Oh, nothing. (still giggling)<br>
							<br>
							
						CLARE: What are you laughing about? Tell me.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Oh all right, this is really dumb, really stupid. We&#146;ve been doing this silly, dumb voice.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Clare storms out of the room mad!)<br>
							<br>
							
						CLARE: So is it fun humiliating me?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: No, it&#146;s not you. It&#146;s your stomach, he&#146;s taking with this funny, booming, jovial voice. (doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o.<br>
							<br>
							
						CLARE: So you think I&#146;m fat?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: No it&#146;s&#133;<br>
							<br>
							
						(Darren walks in)<br>
							<br>
							
						DARREN: Mr. Kramer says, &quot;hey buddy!&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hey, we&#146;re kind of in the middle of something here. Would you mind coming back later?<br>
							<br>
							
						DARREN: Oh yeah sure, sure. Should we set something up now?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (Screams) GET OUT!<br>
							<br>
							
						CLARE: I&#146;m leaving too.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: No body said you&#146;re fat. He&#146;s a loving character, like the Kool-ade guy.<br>
							<br>
							
						CLARE: He is fat!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: No, he&#146;s just a little bloated.<br>
							<br>
							
						CLARE: Good-bye!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: It&#146;s mostly water weight.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer walks in)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Boysenberry, the kid is still learning.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Darren is standing in the hallway on the phone)<br>
							<br>
							
						DARREN: Mr. Kramer&#133;Dean, my internship is on line two, she wants to set up a meeting.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Yeah, well nothing before noon.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Line two?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Yeah, your phone is line one.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Oh&#133;<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Scene: At Elaine&#146;s apartment]<br>
							<br>
							
						PUDDY: So the gloves were right by the phone. That is pretty funny.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: See, this is what Jerry&#146;s doesn&#146;t understand. We can see each other. We can see each other every day, but it doesn&#146;t mean we are back together.<br>
							<br>
							
						PUDDY: I mean I love just seeing you and having sex.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Yeah.<br>
							<br>
							
						PUDDY: Not having to do all that&#133;you know&#133;work.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Well, either way&#133;<br>
							<br>
							
						PUDDY: All that calling you, and buying you stuff&#133;<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: David&#133;<br>
							<br>
							
						PUDDY: Caring about how everyone at work isn&#146;t as smart as you. It&#146;s brutal.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Alright that&#146;s it! We&#146;re back together!<br>
							<br>
							
						PUDDY: Oh, no.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oh, yeah.<br>
							<br>
							
						PUDDY: Look Elaine, be reasonable.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Elaine kisses Puddy)<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Get those clothes off. You&#146;re going to spend the night and we&#146;re going to cuddle.<br>
							<br>
							
						PUDDY: What?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: You heard me. Strip!<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Scene: At Play Now]<br>
							<br>
							
						(George is walking in the hallway to his office. He sees his office has been boarded up)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (whistling)&#133;.(laughing)&#133;.Alright&#133;&#133;OK&#133;.<br>
							<br>
							
						(George goes through air vent &#150; in his office)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (on phone &#150; calling secretary) Hello Margery, George Costanza. How are you sweet heart? Listen, can you give Mr. Thomassoulo a message for me? &#133;Yes. If he needs me, tell him (screams) I&#146;M IN MY OFFICE! Thanks.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Scene: At NYU]<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Dean Jones, you wanting to talk to me?<br>
							<br>
							
						DEAN JONES: I&#146;ve been reviewing Darren&#146;s internship journal. Doing laundry&#133;<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: &#133;Yeah.<br>
							<br>
							
						DEAN JONES: &#133;Mending chicken wire, hi-tea with a Mr. Newman.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: I know it sounds pretty glamorous, but it&#146;s business as usual at Kramerica.<br>
							<br>
							
						DEAN JONES: As far as I can tell your entire enterprise is more than a solitary man with a messy apartment which may or may not contain a chicken.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: And with Darren&#146;s help, we&#146;ll get that chicken.<br>
							<br>
							
						DEAN JONES: I&#146;m sorry, but we can&#146;t allow Darren to continue working with you.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Well, I have to say this seems capricious and arbitrary.<br>
							<br>
							
						DEAN JONES: You fly is open.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Scene: At Jerry&#146;s apartment]<br>
							<br>
							
						(Jerry &amp; Clare are talking by the doorway)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: So you&#146;re sure you&#146;re not still angry about last night?<br>
							<br>
							
						CLARE: No, I&#146;m fine. Just as long as you don&#146;t ever do that voice again.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Never?<br>
							<br>
							
						CLARE: Never.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What about if you&#146;re not around?<br>
							<br>
							
						CLARE: No!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: So I have to choose between seeing you and doing the voice?<br>
							<br>
							
						CLARE: That&#146;s right.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I can do that.<br>
							<br>
							
						CLARE: So what&#146;s your decision?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I don&#146;t know.<br>
							<br>
							
						(At the dock or beach)<br>
							<br>
							
						(Jerry is thinking to himself &#150; looking quite funny)<br>
							<br>
							
						(He&#146;s thinking about all the times him and Clare spent together. He&#146;s trying to decide if he likes her more or the voice more)<br>
							<br>
							
						(Jerry knocks on Clare&#146;s door)<br>
							<br>
							
						CLARE: Jerry&#133;HI.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o. La-la-la. (haha)<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Scene: At Jerry&#146;s apartment]<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: You broke up with her? Why?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: So we could do the voice. (doing the voice) La-la-la. What&#146;s the matter?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I think I&#146;m getting tired of it. I mean is that all it does? Hello? La-la-la?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: No, it can do anything. It can be Spanish. (doing the voice) Hola. Hello-o-o-o.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I think I like the girl better than the voice.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Really?<br>
							<br>
							
						(Elaine walks in &#150; how does she keep getting up without that buzzer?!)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Still?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I told you.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Alright, here you go, choke on it (hands him money).<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: See, never bet against the backslide. I knew you two would get back together.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Yeah, well not for long. I&#146;m breaking up with him.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: No, I don&#146;t think so. I&#146;ve seen you two together. You make each other miserable. It&#146;s kismet.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Double or nothing.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Done.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (talking from bathroom) Witness?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You&#146;re in there again.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I think Play Now is putting something in my food.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer walks in)<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Alright, I&#146;m out of here.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What is this? (Kramer is wearing jeans that look like it doesn&#146;t fit him).<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: I don&#146;t know. I found them in your closet. Ever since Darren left I haven&#146;t been able to find anything. He took all my clothes to some cleaners. I&#146;m clueless. (looks at clock) Is that clock right?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yeah. Nine o&#146;clock.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: I was supposed to pick up Newman at the zoo twelve hours ago.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (doing the voice) Good-bye Kramer.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Jerry, buddy, I got to tell you something. That voice is played.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Really?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: So played.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I told you.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Scene: Hallway, Darren is knocking on Kramer&#146;s door]<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Darren? What are you doing here? The college canceled the internship.<br>
							<br>
							
						DARREN: I don&#146;t care about the internship. I care about Kramerica.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Kramerica is no more.<br>
							<br>
							
						DARREN: What about the oil tanker bladder system? We were going to put an end to maritime oil spills.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Probably. Darren, you go home. Forget about Kramerica.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer slams door)<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer opens door)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Well, you&#146;re still here?<br>
							<br>
							
						DARREN: I haven&#146;t had time to leave.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Well, I haven&#146;t changed my mind.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer slams door)<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer opens door)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Well, you are a tenacious little monkey. Alright, I&#146;ll do it. Kramerica industries lives! Let&#146;s get back to work!<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer slams door)<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer opens door)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Let&#146;s see what Jerry has to eat.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Scene: At Play Now &#150; in the bosses office]<br>
							<br>
							
						THOMASSOULO: You win George. We&#146;ve had it. If you leave right now, Play Now will give you six months pay. That&#146;s half of your entire contract. Please&#133;just go.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: You see if I stay the whole year, I get it all.<br>
							<br>
							
						THOMASSOULO: Want to play hand ball huh? Fine. (calls on intercom) Attention Play Now employees, George Costanza&#146;s handicapped bathroom is now open on the sixteenth floor to all employees and their families.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Well played.<br>
							<br>
							
						THOMASSOULO: I&#146;ll see you in hell Costanza.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Scene: At Jerry&#146;s apartment]<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (on the phone with Clare) Clare thanks for giving me a second chance. Our relationship is certainly worth more than some silly, stupid voice. Hold on one second. (George walks in &#150; Jerry asks George) So we definitely don&#146;t want to do the voice anymore? (George shakes his head NO) Alright, we&#146;re back together again, great. Bye bye.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Scene: Hallway &#150; Kramer &amp; Darren are pushing an oil tank]<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Hey.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Trouble down at the plant?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: It&#146;s a tank of oil. Darren and I are finally going to test out my bladder system.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: You have to drink that whole thing?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: No. No. No. It&#146;s for oil tankers. All I need to do is fill some sort of rubber container with oil and then drop it to see whether or not it can restrain the impact.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I understand (not really understanding, lol).<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Would a giant rubber ball work?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Conceivably.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Well, Play Now has all kinds of different rubber balls. Why don&#146;t we test your bladder system at my office?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You&#146;re not&#133;<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Oh, yes I am. Mr. Thomassoulo likes to play dirty. Well, there&#146;s nothing dirtier than a giant ball of oil.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Scene: At Monk&#146;s Cafe]<br>
							<br>
							
						PUDDY: Hey, you want to split a root beer (I think that&#146;s what he says)?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I don&#146;t think so David, we&#146;re through.<br>
							<br>
							
						PUDDY: Oh&#133;That&#146;s a nice sweater (Elaine smiles).<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Scene: At Elaine&#146;s house &#150; the two are in bed]<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Whew that was a dozy.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Scene: At Jerry&#146;s apartment]<br>
							<br>
							
						(Elaine throws down money on the table).<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Go again?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Book it.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (again from bathroom) Witness.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Scene: At Elaine&#146;s apartment]<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: David I know this hurts, but it&#146;s the way it has to be (Puddy is giving her a look like he&#146;s going to still get some).<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Scene: At Jerry&#146;s apartment]<br>
							<br>
							
						(Elaine is placing money on the table one by one)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha ha.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Scene: Jerry and Elaine at the movies]<br>

							<br>
							
						(Elaine hands Jerry money)<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: So, how did it end?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: They got away.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: uh.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Scene: At Elaine&#146;s apartment]<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Listen David, I&#146;ve got to run. Can you lend me fifty bucks?<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Scene: At Play Now]<br>
							<br>
							
						(Darren &amp; Kramer are pushing the ball of oil &#150; Jerry walks in)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hey.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Did you bring the video camera?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yeah, I put a six hour tape in. That should cover the experiment, the arrest, and most of your trial. Alright, I&#146;ll see ya.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Oh, you might want to stick around Jerry. Mr. Thomassoulo picked the wrong man to hire because he was fake handicapped.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I can&#146;t. I got to meet Clare.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: You gave up the voice?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yeah, I thought it was stupid. Unless you guys are liking it again.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER &amp; GEORGE: No. No<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Darren?<br>
							<br>
							
						DARREN: Sorry Mr. Seinfeld.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Uh, bathroom.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Hey, use mine. I&#146;ll let you in.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I thought it was open to the public.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I uh, took care of that.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Both go to the bathroom, which looks really nice)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Wow! Zanadu . No wonder you&#146;re putting in so many hours. (looks at urinal) May I?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I insist. I&#146;ll fix us a drink. (phone rings &#150; who would that be?) I got it.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Back to Kramer &amp; Darren in George&#146;s office]<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Whew. You know Darren, if you would have told me twenty-five years ago that some day I&#146;d be standing here about to solve the worlds energy problems, I would&#146;ve said you&#146;re crazy&#133; Now let&#146;s push this giant ball of oil out the window.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Back in the bathroom]<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: So, check out my view.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Wow! Hey, there&#146;s Clare. I better go down.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Hey, there&#146;s Kramer &amp; Darren.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: There&#146;s the giant ball of oil. Clare&#146;s right underneath that thing. Clare! Hello-o-o-o! Hello-o-o-o! Hello-o-o-o!<br>
							<br>
							
						CLARE: I don&#146;t believe this. I am not looking up if you&#146;re going to do that voice.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Bombs away (Uh oh).<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: This is going to be a shame.<br>
							<br>
							
						(SPLAT!)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Hello.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Well, that didn&#146;t work. Hey, how about this&#133;ketchup and mustard in the same bottle?<br>
							<br>
							
						DARREN: Oh that sounds interesting sir.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Yeah.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Police sirens &#150; uh oh)<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Scene: At Monk&#146;s Caf&eacute;]<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Clare won her lawsuit against Play Now. Gee, Play Now is filing for bankruptcy. I guess you&#146;re not going in anymore.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Yeah.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: So they&#146;re not paying you your&#133;<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: No.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: So you&#146;re pretty much&#133;<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Yeah.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What ever happened to Darren?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Darren is going away for a long long time.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: So Clare sure looked real funny covered in oil like that&#133; (doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o I got beamed with a giant ball of oil&#133;<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (doing the voice) I&#146;m slippery as an eel&#133;<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: (doing the voice) La la la.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I&#146;m just so glad it&#146;s back.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Scene: At Elaine&#146;s apartment in bed with Puddy AGAIN)<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: See, this is good. This is the way it should be. You know why are we fooling ourselves. We belong together.<br>
							<br>
							
						PUDDY: ELAINE: I want to break up.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Ah nuts!<br>
