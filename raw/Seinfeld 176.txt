						[INT. JERRY'S CAR - DAY]<br>
							<br>
							
						(The gang drives along in Jerry's car with the top down. Elaine and Kramer sit in the back, George is shotgun, and Jerry behind the wheel.)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Man, I'm starving.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: How can you be hungry after what you ate at that Mets game?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Because ballpark food doesn't count as real food.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Right. It's just an activity. It's like that paddle with the ball and the rubber band.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: You know, my friend Bob Saccamano made a fortune off of those. See he came up with the idea for the rubber band. Before that, people would just hit the ball, and it would fly away.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I can't believe you all made me leave before the end of the game.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oh, come on, Jerry. It was 9 to nothing. We were getting shellacked.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Those nachos are killing me.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I thought you were hungry.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: It's complicated.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Come on, Jerry, you're going to miss the exit.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Keep your shirt on. I got it.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Watch out for that maroon Golf.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Oh, boy.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Look at this guy. He's trying to box me out.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: I'll tell you when you can go. Wait, wait, wait, Wait-- now, now, now. No, no, no. Go, go! No, no. Wait-- now, now! Now! Jerry! Go--ahh...<br>
							<br>
							
						(Jerry swerves into another lane. Lamar, the driver of the maroon Golf honks the horn.)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Oh, calm down, maroon Golf. He thinks I cut him off. He accelerated.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: You want me to moon him? Ooh, let's moon him. Roll up your window. Let's do a pressed ham under glass.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oh, no, I couldn't do that.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Look at this, look at this. He's giving us the finger.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oh, all right.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Yeah.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Elaine and Kramer get up to moon Lamar.)<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[INT. JERRY'S CAR - DAY]<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: So I saw that new movie about the Hindenburg.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oh, yeah. What's that called?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Blimp: The Hindenburg Story.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: How was it?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I found it morose. Why dwell on these negative themes?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yeah. They should make a movie about all the Hindenburg flights that made it.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Anyway, right in the middle, the ship blows up-- burning debris, bodies falling-- and then just as this eerie silence settles over the airfield, I yelled out, &quot;That's gotta hurt!&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Heh.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: The place went nuts.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Imagine the laugh you could have gotten if you'd yelled that out at the actual disaster.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Yeah.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Why are we slowing down?<br>
							<br>
							
						(Music plays in the background.)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What is that music?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: What's with all these flags?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Oh, no.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE AND JERRY: It's the Puerto Rican Day parade!<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Ohh! Oh, the city shuts down Fifth avenue. They never let anyone through. We're never getting home.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer stands up on the back seat.)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: All right. I'm gonna check it out. Aiee. mucho trafico.<br>
							<br>
							
						&nbsp;<br>
							<br>
							
						[STOCK FOOTAGE: Puerto Rican Day parade.]<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[EXT. CITY STREET - DAY]<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer runs along the sidewalk and hops into the back seat of a black Saab.)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Yeah...uhh...well, the streets are all blocked. I think every Puerto Rican in the world is out here.<br>
							<br>
							
						(There is a Puerto Rican family in the car.)<br>
							<br>
							
						PUERTO RICAN MAN: Well, it is our day.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Whoo. Wrong car. Sorry.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer hops out.)<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[INT. JERRY'S CAR - DAY]<br>
							<br>
							
						(Still sitting stopped in traffic are Elaine, Jerry, and George. They are listening to the radio.)<br>
							<br>
							
						RADIO: And the Mets score two in the eighth inning.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: See? If we had stayed, we could have seen those runs.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I could have had some ice cream. I think that might have calmed down the nachos.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I'm going to miss 60 Minutes. You know, I hate to miss 60 Minutes. It's part of my Sunday weekend wind-down.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I don't know how you can unwind with that clock ticking. It makes me anxious.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: All right, gentlemen, I scouted it out. I think we can get out over there.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: But that's a one-way street coming this way. Besides, how am I gonna get all the way over there?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Just inch over. You worm your way.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Just do it, Jerry. Uhh. This exhaust. I'm gonna throw up.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: You know, you should make yourself throw up.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Huh?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: You know you're going to.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: All right, I'm worming.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Hey, Jerry. You know who the grand marshal is of this thing? None other than Miss Chita Rivera.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: They're not letting me in.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: My hand is out.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Well, I think we're gonna need more than a hand. They have to see a human face.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: You sure you want his face?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: No, no, no. It was Mar&iacute;a Conchita Alonso.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: This guy's giving me the stare-ahead.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: The stare-ahead. I hate that. I use it all the time.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Look at me! I am man! I am you!<br>
							<br>
							
						(The man in the other car looks over at George. Elaine, sitting behind George, aids in the cause by pleading to the man by mouthing the words, &quot;Hi, can we go in?&quot;)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: All right, he's letting you in. Thank you! Creep.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Oh! I know who it is. Stacy Keach.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: One more lane to go.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: All right! We're here!<br>
							<br>
							
						(Just as Jerry is about to enter the one-way street, Lamar and his maroon Golf cut him off.)<br>
							<br>
							
						LAMAR: Oh, look who's here. My old buddy, black Saab.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Maroon Golf.<br>
							<br>
							
						LAMAR: Where you goin', black Saab? You seem to be a tad askew.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Could you move your car back a little?<br>
							<br>
							
						LAMAR: Oh. Sorry. I seem to have cut you off.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: All right, I think I know where this is going, and I am going somewhere else.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Elaine pushes George's seat forward slamming his head onto the dashboard. She gets out.)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You can't do that. You can't just leave the group.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I've been trying to leave this group for 10 years. Vaya con dios.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Con dios? Well, that's rude.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Can you believe her?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Yeah. I'll see you later.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Where are you going?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: The movies. Blimp is playing right there.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You're going to that again? Why? Just to do that stupid line?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: It's a performance, Jerry. Like what you do.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: That's not what I do.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Isn't it?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Maybe a little. Ah, hell, I guess it is.<br>
							<br>
							
						(George leaves.)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: You know, actually, Jerry, you haven't worked a room that big in a while.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[STOCK FOOTAGE: Taxis stuck in traffic].<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[INT. TAXI CAB - DAY]<br>
							<br>
							
						(Elaine sits in the back.)<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Look at that guy's dog. I hate it when their ears get flipped inside out like that. Why doesn't he fix it?<br>
							<br>
							
						(She moves so she can yell out the driver's open window.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE (yelling): Hey! Fold your dog's ear back!<br>
							<br>
							
						(She leans back.)<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Ooh! This isn't moving! I could walk faster than this.<br>
							<br>
							
						CAB DRIVER: No, you can't.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Yes, I can. Here. I'm outta here.<br>
							<br>
							
						(She pays her fare and gets out.)<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[EXT. CITY SIDEWALK - CONTINUOUS]<br>
							<br>
							
						(She starts to walk. The cab starts to move.)<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oh, now it's moving. Oh, yeah. I knew it. Hey! Hey!<br>
							<br>
							
						(The cab stops and she gets back in.)<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[INT. TAXI CAB - CONTINUOUS]<br>
							<br>
							
						CAB DRIVER: Where to?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: That's cute. That's really cute. Oh! Come on! All right. Bye again.<br>
							<br>
							
						(She pays and gets out again.)<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[EXT. CITY SIDEWALK - CONTINUOUS]<br>
							<br>
							
						(Again, the cab starts moving when she gets out.)<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Hey. Taxi! Taxi!<br>
							<br>
							
						(She starts to run after the taxi which starts to move faster.)<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[INT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY]<br>
							<br>
							
						(George sits down next to two attractive women.)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Ladies. I, uh, I haven't seen this before.<br>
							<br>
							
						LADY 1: What is that dot?<br>
							<br>
							
						LADY 2: Oh, I think someone has one of those funny laser pointers.<br>
							<br>
							
						(A red laser moves around the movie screen. Everyone laughs as the dot rests on the breasts of the movie actress.)<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[INT. MOVIE LOBBY - DAY]<br>
							<br>
							
						(The laser pointer guy uses his laser to point at a box of Skittles and RC Cola.)<br>
							<br>
							
						LASER GUY: Gimme a box of those and one of those.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Excuse me, are you the guy with that funny laser?<br>
							<br>
							
						LASER GUY: The laser's not funny. I'm funny.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Yeah. The thing is, I, uh...I had this little zinger of my own I wanted to try.<br>
							<br>
							
						LASER GUY: Uh-huh.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: It's right in the explosion scene. So if you could just...leave me a little window. You know, my, uh, my aunt had a thing removed with a laser. All right, I don't want to interrupt your meal, so...<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[INT. JERRY'S CAR - DAY]<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer and Jerry sit listening to the radio.)<br>
							<br>
							
						RADIO What a comeback for the New York Mets-- 6 runs in the bottom of the ninth.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I've gotta see this game. If it wasn't for this guy, we could get out of here.<br>
							<br>
							
						LAMAR: This traffic's a killer, ain't it?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: You want to get outta here? Here's what we do. We leave the car here, we take the plates off, we scratch the serial number off the engine block, and we walk away.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Walk away?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: You've got insurance. You tell them that the car was stolen, and then you get another one free.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Isn't there a deductible?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: All right, what is your deductible?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I don't know.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Yes, because they've already deducted it.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: From what?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: The car, which we're leaving. So the net is zero. See you pocket the money, if there is any, and you get a new car.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: We're not leaving the car!<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: All right. If you refuse to grow up and scam your insurance company, you'll have to work this out with maroon Golf.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Absolutely not. He sped up.<br>
							<br>
							
						RADIO: Swung on, line hard toward left center field. That's in the gap, that's a base hit.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I'm ready to talk.<br>
							<br>
							
						&nbsp;<br>
							<br>
							
						[INT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY]<br>
							<br>
							
						(George and the ladies are sitting in their seats.)<br>
							<br>
							
						LADY 1: Hey! There's that laser guy again.<br>
							<br>
							
						LADY 2: He's funny. I never meet anyone funny.<br>
							<br>
							
						LADY 1: I know. A sense of humor is so much more important to me than looks or hair.<br>
							<br>
							
						LADY 2: Mmm, yeah.<br>
							<br>
							
						(There's an explosion on the screen. The laser moves around the screen and everyone laughs.)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: That's gotta hurt!<br>
							<br>
							
						(Everyone stops laughing.)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: It's...gotta hurt! Hurt! Because...Aaarrrrrgh!<br>
							<br>
							
						(George stands up.)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Damn you, laser guy! You had to grab it all with your lowbrow laser shtick! You're just a prop comic! Where's the craft?!<br>
							<br>
							
						(The laser guy points the laser at George's head.)<br>
							<br>
							
						LADY 1: Look! It's on the bald guy.<br>
							<br>
							
						LADY 2: I am so glad we came to this showing.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[EXT. CITY STREET - DAY]<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer is talking to Lamar while Jerry waits in his car. Kramer walks to Jerry.)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Ok, here's the deal. He wants you to acknowledge that you cut him off with an &quot;I am sorry&quot; wave.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What's that?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: You raise the hand, lower the head-- &quot;I'm sorry, I'm sorry. The buttons are really big on the car. I don't understand it. I haven't read the manual. Ooh!&quot; You get my drift.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Ok!<br>
							<br>
							
						(Jerry puts both hands up over his head and does the &quot;I'm Sorry&quot; wave.)<br>
							<br>
							
						LAMAR: Hallelujah. Praise the lord. But I'll take it.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Yes! All right, Lamar, back it up a little bit so we can get out now.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer gets in the car. George shows up and climbs into the back seat.)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: All right. At last, we're finally gettin' out of here.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What's that on your forehead?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: It's probably chocolate.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hey, is that one of those laser pointers?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Hey, Jerry, crank up the Floyd. It's a George laserium!<br>

							<br>
							
						JERRY: I'm glad I cut you off, because black Saab rules! So long, jackass!<br>

						JERRY: Elaine, why did you have the cab come down the street?! We were almost out!<br>
							<br>
							
						LAMAR: So that was your girlfriend that blocked you in. That's real good.<br>

							<br>
							
						JERRY: Elaine, he doesn't need-<br>

						ELAINE: All right. Well, I'll see ya. Hey, George, I think there's a sniper lookin' to pop ya.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Elaine leaves.)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: This thing can't hurt me, can it? I mean, it is a laser. What if it hits my eye?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I don't know.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I can't be blind, Jerry The blind are courageous.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: You'll be fine as long as it doesn't hit you right in the pupil, 'Cause then the whole ball will go up like the Death Star. Tchoo! I gotta go find a bathroom.<br>

							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Look! No one knows how long this parade is gonna last! They are a very festive people. All I know is that it's Sunday night, and I have got to unwind! Now who's with me?!<br>
							<br>
							
						OLDER WOMAN: Father?<br>

And, um, yes, I'm looking for a place where I can settle down with my, uh, peculiar habits, and, uh, the women that I frequent with. (sniffing wall) Mmm. Mombassa, hmm?<br>
							<br>
							
						SALES WOMAN: The asking price is $1.5 million.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Oh, I spend that much on after shave. Yes, I buy and sell men like myself every day. Now, I assume that there's a waterfall grotto?<br>
							<br>

						ELAINE: Come on, father, you can make it.<br>
							<br>

							<br>
							
						JERRY: What if it gets in the side?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: The side?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yeah. Wouldn't it just bounce back and forth between your cornea and the mirror, faster and faster, getting more and more intense, until finally-<br>
							<br>

							<br>
							
						GEORGE: All right!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Oh. It's in your eye now.<br>

							<br>
							
						SALES WOMAN: Well, it's--<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Balk?! How was that a balk?! You have any snacks?<br>
							<br>
							
						SALES WOMAN: Mr. Varnsen, if you like the apartment, I should tell you I've also had some interest from a wealthy industrialist.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Not Pennypacker!<br>
							<br>
							
						SALES WOMAN: You know him?<br>

							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Yeah, it's like this every day in Puerto Rico.<br>
							<br>
