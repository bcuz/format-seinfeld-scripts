						[Opening monologue]<br>
							<br>
							
						I really like the wig historically. I guess the revolutionary war, the last war fought in wig, and it seems that it must have been hard. You know they're going in to battle,they think Well do I have my bullets? Do I have my bobby pins.. and you got to make sure you have everything... lot more to worry about What if I get killed.? Is my wig on straight? I don't know when the whole wig thing came in to style for men... but I know when it went out.! When the mirror was invented. No guy is looking in the mirror powdering a patch of horsehair on his head going ..All right! lets go rap (?) to the ladies..<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[At the Andover shop]<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I'm looking for a crested blazer<br>
							<br>
							
						CRAIG: A crested blazer..<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I've worn one once and I really think it did something for me.<br>
							<br>
							
						CRAIG: (turning around): Yes .I Think we may have something. (picks up a blazer) The Joseph Aboud crested blazer is the finest.... That's hand ticking around the crest and these are the world famous Corriso buttons made from the finest Andulo corn.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (softly) Hmm.. they'll match my sneakers.<br>
							<br>
							
						CRAIG: It looks fabulous on you... shall I wrap it up?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You know...I'm not sure. I'll tell you what. I'll come back later with someone and see what they think.<br>
							<br>
							
						CRAIG: (doubtful) A Hum!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Really I'll be back.<br>
							<br>
							
						CRAIG: Yeah!<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Cuts to Jerry's apartment.]<br>
							<br>
							
						(George is pacing back and forth with the phone and Elaine and Jerry are talking.)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: So I didn't like the crest all that much., but the guy spent fifteen minutes with me so to get out of the store I told I wanted to see what someone else thought.... And then he makes a face like he doesn't believe me.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Ah! So he knew that you were making it up.!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yeah..... He caught me So here's what I want you to do. Come back with me to the store and we'll pretend to look at the coat.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: That's ridiculous. Why do do you want to go back there if you don't want the coat?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Because he thinks I was lying and I want to show him I wasn't.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: But you were!!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: But if you go back with me , then I'm not.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:(still on the phone) All right fine.... Whatever<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer walks in.)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (to George) Problems with the house guest?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: What house guest?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: This friend of Susan's is staying with us for two weeks...Now am I wrong or is that excessive?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Well Bob Sacamano he stayed with me once for a year and a half.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Who is he?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: He's a wig master<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: What is a wig master?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: He's with the touring company of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. He's the guy in charge of the wigs.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Boy.. imagine.. liking wigs to the point it becomes a career choice.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: About some tickets George , you know I'd kill for a peek..<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (leaving) Yeah, Sure, sure ,,, I got to drop my car off at the new lot.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Euh what...What lot is that?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Jiffy Park. It's incredible.. Seventy-five dollars a month.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Seventy -five bucks a month!<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Yeah and you get this really cool T-shirt when you sign on..<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Oh I'm down.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Cuts to the Andover shop]<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (proud of himself) Remember me? I said I 'd come back with someone and I did. Surprised?.<br>
							<br>
							
						CRAIG: No I believed you.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yeah.... well Elaine.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: (looking up to the salesman)<br>
							<br>
							
						CRAIG: Oh!... hello I'm Craig.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: .....Hi.<br>
							<br>
							
						CRAIG: well (picks up the blazer again) here it is.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oh!!.....Joseph Aboud .. and look at this hand ticking around the crest.<br>
							<br>
							
						CRAIG: You know your coats?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Well I'm in the biz .. I work for J. Peterman.<br>
							<br>
							
						CRAIG: I love J. Peterman.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: (giggling) Ohhh!!.<br>
							<br>
							
						CRAIG: I especially enjoy the catalogue, those fanciful narratives really take me away..<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Ohhh!! really ..well you know what, I write those.<br>
							<br>
							
						CRAIG: No!!!<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Yeeeahh!!!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (impatiently cutting in) Hey Elaine What about the crest.? What d'you think of the crest here.<br>
							<br>
							
						Elaine Well I love it...<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You what??<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I think it's great. I think you should get it.<br>
							<br>
							
						CRAIG: Well .... Will it be check or credit card?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (giving up) Check.<br>
							<br>
							
						CRAIG: I'll need you to write down your phone number on the check for me. (turning to Elaine) Perhaps you could do the same.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: (laughs and giggles like a schoolgirl)<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Cuts to a street where Jerry &amp; Elaine are walking]<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You weren't supposed to say that.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: But I really did like it<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: That's not the point. You put me in a position where I had no choice.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: uhn... Sorry!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: And what about that guy asking you out right in front of me?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: What is the big deal!!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: ...'s very emasculating, he doesn't know the nature of our relationship. You're there approving new clothes.....That's a girlfriend job! How dare he!!<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: He dared....<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Cuts to George's apartment as he comes in.]<br>
							<br>
							
						ETHAN: (sitting in the couch and combing his wigs)Hi George.. How was your day?<br>

						SUSAN: (walks in) Hi sweety How was your day?<br>

						ETHAN: I already ask him that. He said Good...Good day....<br>
							<br>
							
						(George scratches his head and the scene cuts to Jerry and Kramer's hallway)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: (frantically pulling at his doorknob) Thank god you're home. I'm wiped out. I drop my car at Jiffy Park and I forgot to take my apartment keys off the ring. So you got my spare?<br>

							<br>
							
						KRAMER: I'm not going to take the bus that's why I got a car!<br>

							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Awright I'm gonna get George to pick me up.<br>

						[Cuts to Jerry's apartment. Jerry and Kramer are watching tv.]<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You know that clothing salesman had a lot of nerve hitting on Elaine right in front of me. He stands to make a big commission too on that jacket with the crest that nobody seems to like. You know what I'm gonna do.? I'm gonna take that jacket back.. I'm putting this guy ....RIGHT OUT OF COMMISSION....<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Heeeeeummmrph.... I'm gonna turn in<br>

						KRAMER: Yeah,I had a tough day<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: It's only nine o clock.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Well ..I don't argue with the body Jerry. It's an argument you can't win.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I can't go to sleep at nine o clock!<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Well you can go to your room and read.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hey look ,you know, you're the one who's locked out. I'm letting you stay here. You're wearing my bathrobe. You should adapt to me.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: But I'm tired..<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Oh why don't you go sleep over at Newman's.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Aah! He's got a girl up there. This quilt is too thin...I know I'm gonna get cold. I don't even fit on this couch. Don't even know if I'm gonna sleep....<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Well that's all I got.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Can I sleep with you?<br>
							<br>

							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Why?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Why?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Yeah!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Do I really have to explain why?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Well I......( Elaine pops in at that moment)<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Hi!.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Hi...........What's that?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Squire's walking stick. I had to write about it for the catalogue.<br>

						ELAINE: You can have ,I don't need it anymore.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Ooh Mama...( walks away)<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Ok so ..I am positive you are wrong about Craig.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yeah Why?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Because he told a man he'd give him a discount too... a man Jerry.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: So ,Who is he?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Some friend of his from England.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Don't you see?...........It's all a big scam.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: You're nuts!<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: How do you know he's not wondering the same thing about you?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: What d'you mean?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: What do I mean?.. Well perhaps he thinks that you're working him for the discount. Shaking that little butt of yours into big, big savings.... And then when you get it,you know, you drop him like a hot potato.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Aawwh Please.....<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Now see the two of you need to work on trust... and then and only then will there be a free exchange of sex and discounts.. Cornerstones of a healthy relationship....and now if you would (taps twice on the door) excuse us. We need to get to bed.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>

						GEORGE: Excuse me...huh... I think I made a big mistake. I'd like my deposit back please.<br>
							<br>
							
						ATTENDANT: Whats the problem<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: You got hookers turning tricks in my car. How's that for starters.<br>
							<br>
							
						ATTENDANT: Haaan! That is all hearsay.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Allright, very good I'd like my car and my deposit back please<br>
							<br>
							
						ATTENDANT: Can't do it'<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Whadday'mean.?<br>
							<br>
							
						ATTENDANT: If you read the agreement you signed the deposit is not refundable.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Well does it say anywhere in the contract about my car being used as a whorehouse? 'Cause I don't remember reading that clause either..<br>
							<br>
							
						ATTENDANT: What can I tell you buddy. Take it up with Consumer Affairs.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE:. All right , just give me my car and let me get the hell out of here.<br>
							<br>
							
						ATTENDANT: Well that's going to be a problem<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Why?<br>
							<br>
							
						ATTENDANT: It's all the way in the back. Can't get it out for a couple of days.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: What are you talking about.. I WANT MY CAR!!<br>
							<br>
							
						ATTENDANT: We ask that you please bear with us.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Bear with you! This is a parking lot PEOPLE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO GET<br>

						[Scene cuts to the Andover shop.]<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Excuse me I'd like to return this jacket.<br>
							<br>
							
						TELLER: Certainly. May I ask why?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: ........For spite...<br>
							<br>
							
						TELLER: Spite?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: That's right. I don't care for the salesman that sold it to me.<br>
							<br>
							
						TELLER: I don't think you can return an item for spite.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What do you mean?<br>
							<br>
							
						TELLER: Well if there was some problem with the garment. If it were unsatisfactory in some way, then we could do it for you, but I'm afraid spite doesn't fit into any of our conditions for a refund<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: That's ridiculous, I want to return it. What's the difference what the reason is.<br>
							<br>
							
						TELLER: Let me speak with the manager...excuse me .............Bob!<br>
							<br>
							
						(walks over to the manager and whispers)<br>
							<br>
							
						TELLER: ........spite.....(Manager walks over)<br>
							<br>
							
						BOB: What seems to be the problem?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Well I want to return this jacket and she asked me why and I said for spite and now she won't take it back.<br>
							<br>
							
						BOB: That's true. You can't return an item based purely on spite.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY:. Well So fine then ..then I don't want it and then that's why I'm returning it<br>
							<br>
							
						BOB: Well you already said spite so......<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: But I changed my mind..<br>
							<br>
							
						BOB: No...you said spite...Too late.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
