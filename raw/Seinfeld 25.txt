						[Opening monologue]<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: ....hair that was on your shower soap today could be in your head tomorrow. How did they do the first transplant? Did they have the guy take a shower , get his soap , rush it in there by helicopter, you know keep the soap alive on the soap support system ....looks it over. &quot;We got the hair but I think we lost the Zest.&quot; ....rejects the transplant with organs. Is it possible that a head could reject the hair transplant . Guy just standin' there and suddenly... ..Bink! ( motions hair flying out of his head)........lands in someone's frozen yogurt.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Jerry's apartment]<br>
							<br>
							
						(A repairman is working on his fridge , Jerry doing work with headphones on.)<br>
							<br>
							
						REPAIRMAN: .....The gaskets that you have here are asymmetrical.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Ah..ha!.. really. ( Jerry is barely listening to him )<br>
							<br>
							
						REPAIRMAN: So I took off the motor relay on the compressor....'cos you..you (stutters) you've got some discoloration<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Oh! well whatever you have to do.<br>
							<br>
							
						REPAIRMAN: I was working with one.....mount at a time 'cos you don't wanna disturb the position of the compressor.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (sarcastically) No you don't..<br>
							<br>
							
						(George enters the apartment.)<br>

						GEORGE: Oh! you taped it?<br>

							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Hey! Did 'ya ever do that thing on the toes that I said .<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Huh?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Yeah! like the big toe is like the captain of the toes, but sometimes the toe next to the big toe gets so big that there's like a power struggle and the second toe assumes control of the foot.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: The&quot; coup d&eacute;-toe&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Yeah. Did you do it?<br>
							<br>

							<br>
							
						JERRY: What for?<br>

							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Discovered a cure for baldness.<br>
							<br>
							
						REPAIRMAN: Did you see that last night?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: It was on CNN ( Kramer comes in and he is taping from a Camcorder) This Chinese doctor Zeng Zau. has discovered a cure for baldness.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (to Kramer) What's this?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Well I just got it. Spector gave it to me , he's giving everything away...becoming a minimalist.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Is that the guy who likes fat women?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Doesn't the fat fetish conflict with the minimalism.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: (to George) You , you know what you should've done is watching that report on CNN last night.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I did, I'm trying to call China.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: You can't call China now its like, what, three 'O clock in the morning there<br>

						GEORGE: Wa..Wait.Wait!......Who is this woman?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I don't know . I have no idea . I was just listening and she came on.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: This is like a Penthouse letter...Why can't I meet women like this?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: All right Come on....again attempts to pull headphones off)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: WAIT ,WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!!!!.... Where was the tape recorder?<br>

						JERRY: It was in the back of the room on the left, she must have been sitting right in front of it.<br>
							<br>

						KRAMER: C'mon it's my turn.<br>

						ELAINE: What did she say?<br>

						PETER: Seinfeld.....( from way in the back of the restaurant. Cheesy plot device to have Jerry leave the table for a minute so George and Elaine can talk)<br>

						GEORGE: Oh! no no nothing....<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Now listen , promise me you won't tell him Okay.I want to have a little fun with this.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I had no Idea you were filled with such....sexuality..<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oh! That was nothing. So listen, what about this bald thing?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Ah! Some bald thing, a bald thing I dunno. It's nothing<br>

						GEORGE: Peter?<br>
							<br>

						[Back to Jerry's]<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Oh! my god. Oh! man...<br>

						JERRY: I don't get it. Why would a woman do that and then leave no way to get in touch with her.<br>
							<br>

							<br>

							<br>
							
						JERRY: ..She was sitting at the table where I had my tape recorder...Okay great. Thanks again.. bye. HA Ha..Who do these women think they're dealing with? Did she think she was gonna leave this incredibly erotic message on my tape and I was just gonna let it go. Not Bloody likely...<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: What is that?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: That's my cockney accent.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Naw ,na , that's no good.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Lets hear yours.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Not bloody likely..<br>

						JERRY: That's the worst cockney accent I've ever heard in my life.( George enters) Hey! Georgie boy , guess what I got.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Guess, what I got.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Oh! Is that the bald stuff?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: From China. All the way from China.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Wait,wait wait...Let me get the camera.<br>

						GEORGE: No Don't get the camera , we don't need the camera. Listen I know your skeptical , but I really believe in the Chinese.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yes I am skeptical.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Why do you have to be so suspicious of every one. This is a great man Zeng Zau, he wants to help bald people.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: W..W..Wa...Wa..Wait..Wait wait.. Now lets videotape your head for the before picture, so we can watch how it grows and stuff. Sit down (George sits).....Lean back...A little bit to the right.<br>

							<br>
							
						GEORGE: All right, all right ( Goes to the bathroom)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: He's a happy camper huh?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Happy camper , I don't hear that expression enough.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Remember that guy who took my jacket. The one I found at my mother's house.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yeah.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: My mother told me that he got arrested for mail fraud<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: No kidding?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: He's in jail.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What happened to the jacket. Did he take it with him?<br>
							<br>
