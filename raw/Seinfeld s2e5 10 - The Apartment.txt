						INT. COMEDY CLUB &#150; NIGHT<br>
							<br>
							
						(Jerry is on stage, performing.)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Well, I painted my apartment again. I&#146;ve been living in this apartment for years and years, and every time I paint it, it kinda gets me down. I look around, and I think, well, it&#146;s a little bit smaller now. You know, I realize it&#146;s just the thickness of the paint, but I&#146;m aware of it. It just coming in and coming in. Every-time I paint it, it&#146;s closer and closer. I don&#146;t even know where the wall outlets are anymore. I just look for like a lump with two slots in it. Kinda looks like a pig is trying to push his way through from the other side. That&#146;s where I plug in. My idea of the perfect living room would be the bridge on the Starship Enterprise. You know what I mean? Big chair, nice screen, remote control... That&#146;s why Star Trek really was the ultimate male fantasy. Just hurtling through space in your living room, watching TV. That&#146;s why all the aliens were always dropping in, because Kirk was the only one that had the big screen. They came over Friday nights, Klingon boxing, gotta be there.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						INT. JERRY&#146;S APARTMENT &#150; DAY<br>
							<br>
							
						(Jerry and Elaine are looking at Kramer with their arms folded. His hair is slicked back.)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What did you do?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Mousse. I moussed up.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I guess it was just a matter of time.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: You know, I should've done this years ago. I mean, I feel like I've had two lives. My pre-mousse. And now, I begin my post-mousse. Hey, tell me the truth, have you ever seen a better looking guy?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Well, looks are so subjective.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I don&#146;t mean to interrupt or anything, but on Sunday, my friend is having a brunch for the New York Marathon.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: (annoyed that he forgot) Oh, I keep forgetting to enter that!<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: She lives right above First Avenue, says she has a perfect view of the race. And she said I can invite some friends.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Maybe.<br>
							<br>
							
						(A loud argument can be heard in the hallway between HAROLD and MANNY, the building supervisors.<br>
							<br>
							
						HAROLD: (O.S.) No, I&#146;m not going up there.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Manny screams out something in Spanish.)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (to Elaine) Harold and Manny.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						INT. BUILDING&#146;S HALLWAY &#150; CONTINUING<br>
							<br>
							
						(Harold and Manny are arguing.)<br>
							<br>
							
						HAROLD: I&#146;m not going.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Manny says something in Spanish. Jerry enters the hallway.)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Boys, boys.<br>
							<br>
							
						HAROLD: Oh, Jerry.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I slid the rent under your door, Harold. Did you get it?<br>
							<br>
							
						HAROLD: Yeah, yeah... Hey, Jerry, would you like anything from Mrs. Hudwalker&#146;s apartment?<br>
							<br>
							
						MANNY: (in Spanish) You can't give him anything from there!<br>
							<br>
							
						HAROLD: I was only joking. (to Jerry) He thinks I&#146;m gonna give you Mrs. Hudwalker&#146;s things.<br>
							<br>
							
						MANNY: (in Spanish) You offered them to him.<br>
							<br>
							
						HAROLD: (to Jerry) We have to go up there now and clean the apartment. It&#146;s a good thing her rent was overdue. She&#146;d be rotting up there for a month.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: She died? Mrs. Hudwalker died?<br>
							<br>
							
						HAROLD: Ninety-four years old. I found her yesterday. She didn&#146;t have her wig on. It was horrifying.<br>
							<br>
							
						MANNY: (in Spanish) Harold, Come on, hurry up!<br>
							<br>
							
						HAROLD: (to Manny) What&#146;s the matter with you? I&#146;m talking! So, Jerry, you know anyone who needs an apartment?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Are you kidding? You know my friend Elaine?<br>
							<br>
							
						HAROLD: Oh yeah, I like her. She always says hello to me.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: It&#146;s not promised to anybody? &#145;Cause she&#146;d take it in a second.<br>
							<br>
							
						HAROLD: Well, Manny wanted it for his brother, but he got deported.<br>
							<br>
							
						MANNY: (in spanish) What do you mean deported? It was a misunderstanding with the Department of Immigration.<br>
							<br>
							
						HAROLD: What&#146;s the difference? It&#146;s true!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: So, it&#146;s okay? I could just tell her she can have it?<br>
							<br>
							
						HAROLD: Sure, sure. She&#146;s getting a bargain, too. It&#146;s only four hundred dollars a month.<br>
							<br>
							
						MANNY: (in Spanish) Four hundred dollars? What are you nuts? Someone will pay more.<br>
							<br>
							
						HAROLD: Okay...<br>
							<br>
							
						(Manny keeps talking in Spanish.)<br>
							<br>
							
						HAROLD: Okay!<br>
							<br>
							
						(Jerry goes back to his apartment, passing Kramer on the way. Kramer models his new hairdo for the boys.)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Hey, Harold, what do you think?<br>
							<br>
							
						HAROLD: Manny, look. Kramer put mousse in his hair.<br>
							<br>
							
						MANNY: (in Spanish) It looks worse.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: (not understanding him) Hey, thanks.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						INT. JERRY&#146;S APARTMENT &#150; DAY<br>
							<br>
							
						(Jerry enters.)<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: What was that all about?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (coyly) Oh, nothing important.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: What&#146;s going on? What is that look?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What look? Nothing.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Something&#146;s going on here.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I don&#146;t know if you should sit for this or not. Sitting is good if you faint, but standing is good for jumping up and down. I can&#146;t decide.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Jumping up and down? What are you talking about? C&#146;mon. Cough it up.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Oh, Elaine. You know the way I am &#150; rarely ever thinking of myself. My only concern is the welfare and happiness of those close to me. Sure, it hurts sometimes to give, and give, and give...<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Would you please?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What would you say if I told you that...<br>
							<br>
							
						(Jerry lets his words hang in the air.)<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Told me what?!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: ...I got you an apartment in this building.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: (dumbfounded) No.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yes.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: No.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yes.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: You didn&#146;t.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I did.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: You got me an apartment in the building?!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I got you an apartment in the building.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: How did you...<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Remember Mrs. Hudwalker? The ninety-four-year-old woman who lived above me?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: No.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: She died.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: (thrilled) She died?!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: She died.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: She died!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: And the rent is only four hundred dollars a month!<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Get out!<br>
							<br>
							
						(Elaine pushes Jerry with both hands. Jerry stumbles back.)<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Four hundred a month? Only four hundred a month?!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Four hundred a month.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: And I&#146;ll be right upstairs?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Right upstairs.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Right above you?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Right above me.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oh, we&#146;re neighbors. I&#146;ll be here all the time!<br>
							<br>
							
						(Jerry is starting to regret his actions.)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: All the time.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: (overly excited) We can exchange keys so we can come in and out. Oh, this is going to be great!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: All the time.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						INT. COMEDY CLUB &#150; NIGHT<br>
							<br>
							
						(Jerry is on stage, performing.)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: The problem with talking is that nobody stops you from saying the wrong thing. I think life would be a lot better if it was like you&#146;re always making a movie. You mess up, somebody just walks on the set, and stops the whole shot. You know what I mean? Think of the things you wish you could take back. You&#146;re out somewhere with people, &#147;Gee, you look pregnant.. are you?&#148; &#147;Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, that&#146;s not gonna work at all. Walk out the door, and come back in. Let&#146;s take this whole scene again. People, think about what you&#146;re saying!&#148;<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						INT. MONK&#146;S DINER &#150; NIGHT<br>
							<br>
							
						(George pays his bill at the cashier.)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Thanks, see you later, Donna.<br>
							<br>
							
						(George walks outside.)<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						EXT. MONK&#146;S DINER &#150; CONTINUING<br>
							<br>
							
						(George runs into Jerry outside the restaurant.)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: What happened to you?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You can&#146;t believe what I just did.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: What? What did you do?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I could tell you what I did, but you wouldn&#146;t believe it. It&#146;s not believable.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: What did you do?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: How could I have done that?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Done what?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I told Elaine about an apartment opening up in my building. She&#146;s going to move in.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Elaine&#146;s moving into your building?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yes. Right above me.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Right above you?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yeah.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: You&#146;re gonna be neighbors.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I know. Neighbors.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: She&#146;s right above you?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Right above me.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: How could you do that?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: &#145;Cause I&#146;m an idiot! You may think you&#146;re an idiot, but with all due respect, I&#146;m a much bigger idiot than you are.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Don&#146;t insult me, my friend. Remember who you&#146;re talking to. No one&#146;s a bigger idiot than me.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Did you ever ask an ex-girlfriend to move into your building?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Did you ever go to a singles weekend in the Pocono&#146;s?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: She&#146;s right in my building! Right above me! Every time I come in the building, I&#146;m gonna have to sneak around like a cat burglar.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: You&#146;re doomed. You&#146;re gonna have to have all your sex at women&#146;s apartments. It&#146;ll be like a permanent road trip. Forget about the home bed advantage.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: But I need the home bed advantage.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Of course. We all do.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Come in for two minutes and sit with me.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I was just in there. It&#146;s embarrassing.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Oh, who&#146;s gonna know?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: They saw me walk out.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Two minutes.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Jerry opens the door. George gestures to the people in the window of the coffee shop that he has no choice. They enter.)<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						INT. MONK&#146;S DINER &#150; LATER<br>
							<br>
							
						(Jerry and George are at a booth.)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: My censoring system broke down. You know that little guy in your head who watches everything you say? Makes sure you don&#146;t make a mistake? He went for a cup of coffee. And in that second ruined my life.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: My censor quit two years ago. He checked into a clinic. Emotionally exhausted.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: So, is there any way out of this Elaine thing?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Tough.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You know, the water pressure&#146;s terrible in my building. And she loves a good shower.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I never heard of anyone would turned down an apartment because of a weak shower spray.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: If they were fanatic about showers, they might.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: For that rent, she&#146;d take a bath in the toilet tank if she had to.<br>
							<br>
							
						(There&#146;s a woman at the counter feeding her kid, who sits in a stroller.)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Look at that woman feeding her baby greasy, disgusting, coffee shop corned beef hash. Isn&#146;t that child abuse?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I&#146;d like to have a kid. Of course, you have to have a date first... Remember my friend, Adam, from Detroit?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yeah, the guy with the flat head.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: He&#146;s a cube. Anyway, he got married six months ago. He told me ever since he&#146;s been wearing a wedding band, women have been coming on to him everywhere he goes.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yeah, I&#146;ve heard that about wedding bands.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I wonder if that&#146;s really true.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: That would be an interesting sociological experiment. You know, Kramer has his father&#146;s band. He&#146;d loan it to you.<br>
							<br>
							
						(George laughs at the idea)<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY &#150; DAY<br>
							<br>
							
						(Outside Kramer&#146;s apartment. George has Kramer&#146;s father&#146;s band on. Kramer is in the doorway.)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Thanks a lot. I&#146;ll give it back to you in a week.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: You know, I don&#146;t even know why you&#146;re fooling around with this ring. I&#146;ve been telling you, get yourself some plugs. Or a piece.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I&#146;m not doing that.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Oh, man. You know, you&#146;re crazy. You&#146;re a good looking guy. What do you want to walk around like that for?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: No, I&#146;ll put half a can of mousse in my head like you.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Harold and Manny are arguing down the hall.)<br>
							<br>
							
						HAROLD: I told you I don&#146;t like these sponges, they&#146;re too small! I want a big sponge!<br>
							<br>
							
						(Manny yells in Spanish.)<br>
							<br>
							
						HAROLD: You can&#146;t pick up anything with these! There&#146;s no absorption!<br>
							<br>
							
						(Manny yells in Spanish. Jerry exits his apartment.)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Boys, boys.<br>
							<br>
							
						HAROLD: Hi, Jerry.<br>
							<br>
							
						MANNY: Hello, Jerry. (in spanish to Harold) You tell him.<br>
							<br>
							
						HAROLD: Okay<br>
							<br>
							
						MANNY: (in spanish to Harold again) You tell him.<br>
							<br>
							
						HAROLD: Your friend can&#146;t have the apartment, Jerry.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What?<br>
							<br>
							
						HAROLD: Because somebody offered Manny five thousand dollars for the apartment. I don&#146;t want to do it. Manny wants to do it.<br>
							<br>
							
						MANNY: (in spanish) Why are you telling him it's my fault?<br>
							<br>
							
						HAROLD: Because it&#146;s true! Why shouldn&#146;t I tell him?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hey, hey. I understand. You&#146;re businessmen.<br>
							<br>
							
						MANNY: (in spanish) Tell him that if his friend can come up with the same money then she can have the apartment.<br>
							<br>
							
						HAROLD: Oh, now, he says that if your friend has five thousand dollars, we&#146;ll give it to her.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Well, that&#146;s a lot of money. But, if that&#146;s the way it&#146;s gotta be, that&#146;s the way it&#146;s gotta be.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Jerry returns to his own apartment.)<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						INT. JERRY&#146;S APARTMENT &#150; DAY<br>
							<br>
							
						(George is there. Jerry enters.)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You know, I used to think that the universe is a random, chaotic sequence of meaningless events, but I see now that there is reason and purpose to all things.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: What happened to you?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Religion, my friend, that&#146;s what happened to me. Because, I have just been informed that it&#146;s going to cost Elaine the sum of five thousand dollars to get the apartment upstairs.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (jubilant) Five thousand dollars? She doesn&#146;t have five thousand dollars!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Of course she doesn&#146;t have five thousand dollars!<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: So, she can&#146;t get the apartment.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Can&#146;t get it.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: So, she doesn&#146;t move in.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: No move. So, you see, it&#146;s all part of a divine plan.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: And how does the baldness fit into that plan?<br>
							<br>
							
						(The intercom buzzes. Jerry presses the first button.)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (to the intercom) Elaine?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Yeah.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Jerry opens his door.)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (to George) All right, this is going to require some great acting now. I have to pretend I&#146;m disappointed. You&#146;re going to really see me being a phony, now. I hope you can take this. Maybe you should go in the other room.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Are you kidding? I lie every second of the day. My whole life is a sham!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: &#145;Cause you know, I love Elaine.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Of course you do.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: But you know... not in the building. Really, I feel terrible about this. My intentions were good. What can I do? Tell me.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Elaine appears in the doorway.)<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: (to someone in the hallway) No, I&#146;ll be seeing you. (She enters the apartment; singing) &quot;Good morning, good morning..&#148; (to Jerry and George) Have you ever gotten up in the morning and felt it&#146;s great to be alive? That every breath is a gift of sweet life from above?<br>
							<br>
							
						(George looks at Jerry then head into the other room.)<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oh, and before I forget, I have the checks for the first month, last month&#146;s security deposit. (laughs) I have seventy-five dollars left in my account.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Well... there&#146;s a little bit of a problem.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oh, I know. There&#146;s a weak shower spray, I know. I&#146;ve already thought about it, and I&#146;m switching to baths. As Winston Churchill said, &#147;Why stand when you can sit?&#148; Maybe I&#146;ll get some rubber duckies.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Uh, no uh, someone offered Harold and Manny five thousand for the apartment. I&#146;m sure they&#146;d just as soon give it to you, but you&#146;d have to come up with that money.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Five thousand dollars? I don&#146;t have five thousand dollars.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I know.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: (disappointed) How am I going to get five thousand dollars?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I have no idea.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer enters.)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: (to Elaine) Hey, my new neighbor!<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I&#146;m not moving in.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: What?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: They want five thousand dollars now.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: So, okay uh what&#146;s the problem?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I don&#146;t have five thousand dollars.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: C&#146;mon, you can come up with five thousand dollars. (to Jerry) Jerry, you don&#146;t have five thousand dollars you can led her? Come on.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yeah, well, I didn&#146;t- Is that something you want to borrow?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: No, that&#146;s too much money to borrow.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Loan her the money. You can afford it.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: She doesn&#146;t wanna borrow the money.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Oh, c&#146;mon. She&#146;ll pay you back. What&#146;s five grand between friends?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Of course I&#146;d pay you back..<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Yeah, so what&#146;s the problem?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Who said there&#146;s a problem?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Hey see He said he&#146;d loan you the money.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Well Jerry, it might take a while for me to pay you back. Maybe a few years. How do you feel about that?<br>
							<br>
							
						(Jerry opens his mouth.)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: That&#146;s okay. He doesn&#146;t care.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Well, you know, money can sometimes come between friends.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Jerry opens his mouth.)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Get outta here.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Let me think about it.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: What&#146;s to think about?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I don&#146;t know... I don&#146;t know. Five thousand... let me just take one more look at it.<br>
							<br>
							
						(She leaves.)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (to Kramer) It was all over! Taken care of. Done! Finished. Five thousand. Where&#146;s she gonna get five thousand? She doesn&#146;t have five thousand. Clean. Good bye. She&#146;s gone. Then you come in, &#147;Why don&#146;t you loan her five thousand? What do you care? You&#146;ve got five thousand. Give her five thousand!&#148;<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: You didn&#146;t want her in the building?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: No, I didn&#146;t!<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Well, then what did you loan her the five thousand for? Oh, look, maybe she won&#146;t take it. I mean, she did say that she was gonna think about it.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: People don&#146;t turn down money. It&#146;s what separates us from the animals.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: I still don&#146;t understand what the problem is having her in the building.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Let me explain something to you. You see, you&#146;re not normal. You&#146;re a great guy, I love you, but you&#146;re a pod. I, on the other hand, am a human being. I sometimes feel awkward, uncomfortable, even inhibited in certain situations with the other human beings. You wouldn&#146;t understand.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Because I&#146;m a pod?<br>
							<br>
							
						(George returns from Jerry&#146;s bedroom just as Elaine returns.)<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I&#146;ll take it!<br>
							<br>
							
						(George turns on his heels, and goes back into Jerry&#146;s room.)<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						INT. ROXANNE&#146;S APARTMENT<br>
							<br>
							
						(Guests are milling around, eating. Elaine enters with Jerry and George. Roxanne greets them.)<br>
							<br>
							
						ROXANNE: Hi, Elaine.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oh, hi, Roxanne. Nice to be here. These are my friends. This is George, and this is Jerry.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Jerry and George greet Roxanne.)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hi<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Jerry&#146;s the one who got me my new apartment.<br>
							<br>
							
						ROXANNE: So, you&#146;re Elaine&#146;s hero.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yes, it&#146;s my life&#146;s work.<br>
							<br>
							
						ROXANNE: There are so few true heroes left in this world.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Yeah, my wife couldn&#146;t make it today. She&#146;s got something with her mother... Who knows what&#146;s going on with her. Don&#146;t let any one kid you, it&#146;s tough.<br>
							<br>
							
						(George goes off to mingle.)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Well, better load up on some carbos before the race.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Jerry starts selecting food from the tables.)<br>
							<br>
							
						ROXANNE: Oh, the marathon is great, isn&#146;t it?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Oh, yes. Particularly if you&#146;re not in it.<br>
							<br>
							
						ROXANNE: I wish we had a view of the finish line.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What&#146;s to see? A woman from Norway, a guy from Kenya, and twenty thousand losers.<br>
							<br>
							
						(George is talking to a woman, RITA by the couch.)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: ...yeah, my wife started getting on me about the lawn today. I&#146;m tellin&#146; you, it&#146;s one thing after another.<br>
							<br>
							
						RITA: Is she here?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Uh no no, she&#146;s working.<br>
							<br>
							
						RITA: What does she do?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: She&#146;s an... etymologist. You know, bees, flies, gnats. W-What about you?<br>
							<br>
							
						RITA: I work for the Director of Madison Square Garden. It&#146;s great! I can get free tickets to any sporting in New York. Anyway, she&#146;s a very luck woman. Enjoy the race.<br>
							<br>
							
						(The woman leaves.)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (calling after her) But..<br>
							<br>
							
						(STAN and JOANNE enter the apartment.)<br>
							<br>
							
						ROXANNE: Hi Stan. Joanne.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Jerry, this is Joanne, and this is Stan. They&#146;re in my short story class with Roxanne and me.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hi how are ya?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Hey, Jerry just got me a great apartment in his building!<br>
							<br>
							
						JOANNE: Well, Jerry, it&#146;ll be nice having a close friend nearby.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (no amused) Fantastic.<br>
							<br>
							
						STAN: She can pop in whenever she wants.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I know.<br>
							<br>
							
						JOANNE: She doesn&#146;t even need to knock!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: It&#146;s tremendous.<br>
							<br>
							
						STAN: Anytime of day.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I&#146;m in heaven.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oh, Rita come here. This is Jerry. He&#146;s the one who got me the apartment.<br>
							<br>
							
						RITA: Oh, hi. (calling to someone) Bob, this is the guy who got Elaine the apartment.<br>
							<br>
							
						(George is talking to another woman, SUSIE whom he sits next to on the couch.)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I&#146;m sorry, I don&#146;t see the big deal about being a matador. The bull charges, you move the cape, what&#146;s so hard?<br>
							<br>
							
						(The both laugh.)<br>
							<br>
							
						SUSIE: So uh, are you really married? Because, I&#146;ve actually heard of single guys who wear wedding bands to attract women.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (laughs) You&#146;d have to be a real loser to try something like that.<br>
							<br>
							
						SUSIE: That&#146;s too bad, because I really have a thing for bald guys with glasses.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Susie shrugs, smiles, then leaves George&#146;s side.)<br>
							<br>
							
						RITA: Hey everybody! Here come the runners!<br>
							<br>
							
						(Everyone runs to the windows. Jerry and Elaine stay put.)<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: (to Jerry) So you and Roxanne are hitting it off, huh?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Oh, I wouldn&#146;t quite say that.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Really? From a distance, you seemed to be coming on to her.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I&#146;m a guy &#150; it always looks like that.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Because, I was thinking... are you at all concerned that living in the same building will, y&#146;know... cramp our styles?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Nah...<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Because, I was worried that there might be a situation in which one of us come home with somebody, it could get a little uncomfortable. But, as long as you&#146;re okay with it, it&#146;s fine with me.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Jerry opens his mouth to say something, but Elaine leaves. George is now sitting beside JANICE.)<br>
							<br>
							
						JANICE: I&#146;ve never been able to be with just one person. I can, however, carry on strictly physical relationships which can last for years and years. It&#146;s a shame you&#146;re married.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Janice gets up. George frantically tries to take the ring off.)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Umm, I&#146;m not. It&#146;s just a sociological experiment!<br>
							<br>
							
						JANICE: Please...<br>
							<br>
							
						(George stands up. She leaves George, who proceeds to the snack table. Jerry walks over to him.)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You have no idea what an idiot is. Elaine just gave me a chance to get out and I didn&#146;t take it. (pointing to himself) This is an idiot.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Is that right? I just threw away a lifetime of guilt-free sex, and floor seats for ever sporting event in Madison Square Garden. So please, a little respect. For I am Costanza: Lord of the Idiots!<br>
							<br>
							
						ROXANNE: (yelling out the window) You&#146;re all winners!<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: But suddenly, a new contender has emerged...<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						INT. JERRY&#146;S APARTMENT &#150; DAY<br>
							<br>
							
						(Jerry is talking on the phone with George.)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: George, I didn&#146;t sleep at all last night. I decided I have to tell her. I&#146;m just going to be honest. That&#146;s all... Yes, I&#146;m nervous... Are you listening to me?... Just put some soap on your finger. It&#146;ll slide right off... Then try axle grease... (Kramer enters; to the phone) I&#146;ll call you back after I talk to her... Bye.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Well, it&#146;s all taken care of. Everything&#146;s cool.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What? What&#146;s cool?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Elaine.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What are you talking about?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: I just found a guy who&#146;s willing to pay ten thousand dollars for the apartment.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You what?! Get out! (pushes Kramer) Ten thousand?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Cash.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Who would pay that much?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: He&#146;s in the music business.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Elaine would never borrow that much money! (Jerry hugs Kramer, then grabs him by the cheeks.) Kramer, my God, man! This is beautiful! I think I&#146;m in the clear here. Elaine&#146;s not moving in. I don&#146;t have to confront her. She has no idea I never wanted her to move in. I&#146;m golden!<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Well, occasionally I like to help the humans.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						INT. JERRY&#146;S APARTMENT &#150; NIGHT<br>
							<br>
							
						(The door to Jerry&#146;s apartment is open. Harold and Manny, and Elaine are there. Pulsing music is emanating through the walls.)<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Wow. You&#146;re right. That is loud.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: It&#146;s just unbelievable.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: They rehearse all the time?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: All the time. I&#146;ve been up there six times. They refuse to stop. I can&#146;t live like this. I don&#146;t know what I&#146;m gonna do. I&#146;m heading for breakdown! (to Harold) Can&#146;t you do something?<br>
							<br>
							
						HAROLD: I&#146;m not going up. It stinks up there.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Manny...<br>
							<br>
							
						MANNY: (in Spanish) They&#146;re allowed to play until eleven o&#146;clock!<br>
							<br>
							
						HAROLD: I&#146;m not the one who said eleven o&#146;clock. He makes up his own rules.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Boy, too bad. If I was up there, you&#146;d never hear a peep out of me. I&#146;m as quiet as a mouse.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer enters, and hears the music.)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Oh, I love the one they do right after this one! (Starts dancing)<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						INT. COMEDY CLUB &#150; NIGHT<br>
							<br>
							
						(Jerry is on stage, performing.)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I don&#146;t know. What do you do when a neighbor is making, like, a lot of noise at three o&#146;clock in the morning? I mean, can you knock on someone&#146;s door and tell them to keep it down? You&#146;re really altering your whole self-image. I mean, what am I, Fred Mertz now? What&#146;s happening to me? Can I do this? Am I a shusher? I used to be a shushee. There&#146;s a lot of shushing going on in movie theaters. People are always shushing. &#147;Shh... shh... shhh... shhh...&#148; Doesn&#146;t work, &#145;cause nobody knows where a shush is coming from. They just hear a shh. &#147;Was that a shush? I think somebody just shushed me.&#148; Some people you can&#146;t shush in a movie theater. There&#146;s always that certain group of people, isn&#146;t it? They&#146;re talking and talking, and everyone around them is shushing them, and shushing them. They won&#146;t shush. They&#146;re the unshushables.<br>
