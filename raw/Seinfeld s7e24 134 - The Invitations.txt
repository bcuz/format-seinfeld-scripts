						[Opening monologue]<br>
							<br>
							
						I think that if the wedding invitations were left up to the men, we'd just drive around sticking flyers in windshields ...y' know... Not even typed up either, just Magic Marker, Zerox, you know...Party!!.. What's needed is a divorce announcement; Mr and Mrs Fred Johnson are requesting the honour of your presence at the &quot;returning&quot; of their daughter back to Mr,and Mrs Fred Johnson.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Outside Melody Stationeries]<br>
							<br>
							
						(Susan and George walk into the store and go up the sales clerk.)<br>
							<br>
							
						SUSAN: Hi.<br>
							<br>
							
						CLERK: Hi.. May I help you?<br>
							<br>
							
						SUSAN: Yes, we'd like some wedding invitations.<br>
							<br>
							
						CLERK: Ohh! Well...Congratulations<br>
							<br>
							
						SUSAN: (happily) Thank you.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (mildly embarrassed) yeah.. Thank you.<br>
							<br>
							
						CLERK: When 's the wedding?<br>
							<br>
							
						SUSAN: June<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: late June.<br>
							<br>
							
						CLERK: Oh! Well, we have quite a few to pick from ( turns around and picks up a huge binder) They're arranged in order of price , the most expensive are in the front.<br>
							<br>
							
						(George takes the binder and feigns browsing and flips right to the last page.)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: He..hmmm. humm...What about this one.<br>
							<br>
							
						CLERK: Hmmm,..to tell you the truth they haven't manufactured that one for a number of years. I might have couple of boxes left in our warehouse in New Jersey. I'd have to check.<br>
							<br>
							
						SUSAN: Oh! no. George that's so ugly we don't want that.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: What's the difference you just read it and mail it right back. These we'll do.<br>
							<br>
							
						SUSAN: Why don't they make'em anymore?<br>
							<br>
							
						CLERK: Well.. For one thing the glue isn't very adhesive. It takes a lot of moisture to make them stick.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: So we pick up some (word missing)<br>
							<br>
							
						SUSAN: (disappointed)All right. You see what I do for you.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Scene cuts to the street as Susan and George are about to get into a cab. Kramer happens to walk by.]<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Hey! Kramer.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Hey! George.....Lily..<br>
							<br>
							
						SUSAN: No. Susan.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: No. No It's Lily<br>
							<br>
							
						SUSAN: I think I know my own name.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: It's Susan<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: (lost for words) Well you look like a Lily...<br>
							<br>
							
						&nbsp;<br>
							<br>
							
						[Scene cuts to Jerry's apt. George walks in . Jerry is coming out of his bedroom twiddling scissors.]<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: It's coming Jerry, it's coming.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What's coming?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: The Day..<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Ahhh...The Day..<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: We ordered the wedding invitations today,, Nothing can stop it now. Nothing. It's here! It's happening. Can I do this? I can't do this...Look at me. Look at me I can't do this, I can't do this (manic) Help me Jerry, help me.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: why don't you just break it off with her. tell her it's over<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I can't<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Why not?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE 'Cause I can't face that scene. You know what kind of scene that would be? i'd rather be unhappy for the rest of my life than go through something like that. (forceful) I CAN'T, I CAN'T. I tried to psyche myself up a million times I cannot go through that.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: All right take it easy, just take it easy.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: What about a letter?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: A letter.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I...I...write a letter and then I..I go to China. I disappear in a sea of people for like six months, a year you know just while things simmer down. Ehm.. Ehm...Dear Susan. I'm sorry. I made a terrible mistake. I'm really , really sorry.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: That's it?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: What? Too short?<br>
							<br>
							
						BOTH: Seems a little short, yeah..<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You can't go to China What about your job?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: My Job..arghhh<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: So write a letter.. move to another...move to Staten Island., 'lot easier to blend in a sea of people in Staten Island than China believe me.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Yeah! Yeah!..Staten Island . What about my clothes ,how do I get the rest of the clothes?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Aagh! You come back for your clothes<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I'm not going back in there.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: So forget about your clothes.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Well I'm not starting up a whole new wardrobe now!!!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Look, freedom with no clothes is a lot better than no freedom with clothes.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: If she'd just take a plane somewhere.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: And what, hope for a crash?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: It happens.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You know what the odds are on a crash it's a million to one.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: It's something . It's hope.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Elaine comes through the door)<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Hey!...( sees George) HEY!! Georgie. You know what I just realized; the wedding is like a month away.ha..haa..<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Euhh...Elaine....<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: What?...Oh! by the way. What am I going to be in the wedding party?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: What do you mean?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Well Jerry's gonna be the best man and Kramer's gonna be the usher so what am I gonna be?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I don't know. I don't think you're anything.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Wel...I have to be something. I 'm a close friend....What about being a bridesmaid.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Those are Susan's friends.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Well then...aaahh how about being an usher?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Well...I'll ask Susan about it later.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: You don't ask.. You tell.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: ( to Jerry) What about the letter, should I think about the letter?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hey Elaine if a guy wanted to end a relationship with you . What could he do?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Start smoking.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Smoking.<br>
							<br>

							<br>
							
						JERRY: But you don't smoke.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Nooooooo......<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Scene cuts to Jerry and Elaine walking]<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You know, I think I'm getting a little depressed about George's wedding.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Really?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yeah. Well once he gets married that's it, she'll probably get pregnant, they'll move to Westchester. I'll never see him again.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Yeah! You're probably right.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Then it'll just be me, you and Kramer.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: No! Not me pal. I can't keep this up much longer. I'm sick of being single. I'm getting out.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: So it's just gonna be me and Kramer.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Yep! just you and Kramer.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Elaine walks away)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: See you ... me and Kramer...<br>
							<br>
							
						(Daydreaming sequence set in Jerry's apt. in a probable future. Kramer pops in. They look a little older.)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Hey!! Buddy. I thought of a great invention for driving. A periscope in a car, so you can see the traffic.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (annoyed) How you gonna drive when looking through a periscope? Besides it's not a submarine and there's no room for a periscope in a car.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Huh! You make a higher roof.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: They're not making higher roofs.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: why can't you make a higher roof.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Because it's a stupid idea. No one's gonna go for it. Don't you understand It's stupid ,stupid...<br>
							<br>
							
						(As Jerry slowly comes out of his doze he is about to cross the street as a car comes to him at high speed.)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: .....Stupid , stupid.<br>
							<br>
							
						JEANNIE: Hey! Hey! Look out. (she pulls him back saving his life.) OK!, Are you okay?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yeah!.. Thanks.Oh! my god you saved my life.<br>
							<br>
							
						JEANNIE: Shouldn't there be some kind of reward for that.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: oh! thank you.<br>
							<br>
							
						JEANNIE: You know you should be a lot more careful crossing the street like that, otherwise you could die.. If that bothers you.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Well I...<br>
							<br>
							
						JEANNIE: You see..(points to his collar) To me this is a waste.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What?<br>
							<br>
							
						JEANNIE: The shirt you got on under your sweather. It sits for three weeks in your drawer, waiting to come out. and when it finally does . It sticks up only half an inch out of your collar.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I'm Jerry Seinfeld.<br>
							<br>
							
						JEANNIE: Jeannie Steinman.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hey! Same initials . How do you like that?<br>

						[George and Susan at their apt.]<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Listen I was talking to Elaine today and she said she'd would really like to be an usher at the wedding<br>
							<br>
							
						SUSAN: No. Out of the question. I don't want any women ushers at my wedding and while we're on the subject, Kramer is not an usher either.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Why not?<br>
							<br>
							
						SUSAN: He doesn't even know my name.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: That was an honest mistake.<br>
							<br>
							
						SUSAN: Nah! He's too weird he'd fall or something. He'd ruin the whole ceremony.<br>
							<br>
							
						(George takes out a pack of cigarettes and pulls one out.)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Yeah! You're right.. You're probably right.<br>
							<br>
							
						SUSAN: Whadda doing?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (shrugs and lights it up)<br>
							<br>
							
						SUSAN: Since when do you smoke?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (coughs) I've always smoked.<br>
							<br>
							
						SUSAN: I've never seen you smoke.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Oh yeeah.. well , Big smoker... I (coughs some more) gave it up for a while but it was too tough. Y' know.....I got no will power.<br>
							<br>
							
						SUSAN: I don't like this one bit.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Well(coughs) I can't stop now...(coughs) I'm addicted...<br>
							<br>
							
						SUSAN: Well you are gonna have to quit.<br>
							<br>
							
						(George sprints to the bathroom)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Oh my god....<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[At Monks.]<br>
							<br>
							
						WAITRESS: Menus?<br>

							<br>
							
						JEANNIE: You too.?...<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yeah!!!<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[At Jerry's. Kramer comes in Jerry is on the couch.]<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Hey! Did you hear the bank on the corner is offering a 100 dollars if you go in there and they don't greet you with a hello?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Uh! Really .That's nice.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Now what's with you?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I think I'm in love.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Oh. Come on.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: No it's true. This woman saved my life. I was crossing the street .I was almost hit by a car...and then we talked and.......the whole thing just seemed like a dream.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: If a guy saved your life you'd be in love with him too.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: No, no this woman is different , she's incredible. she's just like me. She talks like me, she acts like me. She even ordered cereal at a restaurant. We even have the same initials. Wait a minute, I just realised what's going on.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: What?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Now I know what I've been looking for all these years......myself! (Kramer is speechless) I've been waiting for me to come along and now I 've swept myself off my feet.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: You stop it man.. you're FREAKING ME OUT!!!<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[At the HOME FEDERAL SAVINGS BANK Kramer walks up to a teller.]<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Hey!<br>
							<br>
							
						TELLER: Hey!<br>
							<br>

						KRAMER: No, No You said Hey!<br>
							<br>
							
						TELLER: Well.. Hey! is Hello, same thing.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: The add said that the bank's gonna pay a hundred dollars if you are not greeted with a hello<br>
							<br>
							
						TELLER: You're taking that much to literally. Now sir , do you have any business to transact.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: No, I want to speak to the manager.<br>
							<br>
							
						TELLER: Well, He's not here right now.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Then I'll be back.<br>
							<br>

						[In Jerry's hallway]<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: So I'm not gonna be an usher?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: No..<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: So I'm nothing. Jerry is best man , Kramer is an usher and I am nothing.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Well Kramer's not an usher anymore.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: What are you talking about?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: You've been demoted.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Why?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Because you called her by the wrong name.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: But she really looks like a Lily<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Jerry ( as they come into the apt.) Jerry, Susan says I can't be an usher at he wedding.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Yeah. me neither.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (shrugs) Hey George I think I want to bring a date to the wedding<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Who!!?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I just met her, she's incredible.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Aaawh...This is GREAT!!.....Now I'm gonna be stuck at the singles table with all the losers.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You can go with Kramer<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: No , no no no no. Weddings are a great place to meet chicks. I have to be unfettered.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Do you see what this is turning in to? Do I need this. I have to get out of this thing.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Did you try the cigarettes?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Yeah.. They made me sick.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: All right, All right. Lets get down here. You really want to get out of this thing ?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Yeah...<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: All right. I got two words for you; Pre-Nup.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: What does that mean?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Ask her to sign a pre-nup.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: What does that do?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Because most women when they're asked to sign a pre-nup are so offended they back out of the marriage.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: They are?... Elaine?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I wouldn't sign one.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Pre-nup of course ..Kramer....<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Get out of here.<br>
