Comedy club - Jerry on stage with the opening monologue

JERRY: Have you ever called someone up, and you're disappointed when they answer the phone?&nbsp; You wanted the machine.&nbsp; You know, and you're always kind of thrown off, (left hand up to side of face, pretending its a receiver) you go &quot;Oh, I eh, I - I didn't know you were there, I ah - just wanted to leave a message saying, sorry I missed you.&quot;

So here what we have is two people who hate each other, don't really ever want to talk, but the phone machine is like this relationship respirator keeping these marginal brain dead relationships alive.&nbsp; And we all do it -- Why? So that when we come home, you can see that little flashing red light.&nbsp; You go &quot;all right, messages.&quot;&nbsp; You see, people need that.&nbsp; It's very important for human beings to feel they are popular and well liked amongst a large group of people that we don't care for.

Stock shot of Hunan Chinese restaurant at night

(Jerry and Naomi enter Jerry's apartment)

JERRY: Well this is it.

NAOMI: Oh, this is nice. Thanks again for the Chinese food.

JERRY: Oh, you're welcome. You know I think I ate too much of that garlic.

NAOMI: Yeah, me too.

JERRY: No, I ate the whole plate. I didn't know those little things were garlic. I thought they were peanuts.

NAOMI: (laughs) - Nnnhhahahahahahahahahahahahahaha (obnoxious laugh). Oh, you know what? I think Naked Gun is on. Oh I've seen it. I laughed through that whole thing. You wanna watch?

JERRY: No, I mean, I don't think so.

NAOMI: I thought you liked to laugh. I thought you were happy go lucky.

JERRY: No, no, no. I'm not happy, I'm not lucky, and I don't go. If anything I'm sad stop unlucky.

NAOMI: Ahahahahahahahahaha.

JERRY: That's not funny Naomi.

NAOMI: Ah hahahaha. (points at Jerry)

JERRY: I didn't mean to be funny there. Why don't you check the TV guide. I think uh, Holocaust is on.

(Jerry goes over to the answering machine and plays the message, then walks back over to the kitchen to get a drink from his bottled water.&nbsp; Naomi sits on the couch looking through the TV Guide, also listening to George's message)

GEORGE: (on the answering machine) Jerry, it's George. Hey, hey are you all set for the weekend. This is going to be great. You're going to have a great time with Naomi.

(Naomi smiles. Jerry takes a sip of water)

GEORGE: (con't) All right, you know she's got that laugh. What did you say? It's like Elmer Fudd sitting on a juicer?

(Naomi stops reading, looks up, pondering what George just said.&nbsp; Jerry puts down his water and sprints over to the machine)

GEORGE: (con't) A-Anyway, I was thinking we would take two cars up to the cabin and that way if one of wanted to stay you know...

(Jerry trying to stop the tape -- he rips the answering machine out of the wall plug)

JERRY: This thing has never worked right. (holding the machine in his hand)

NAOMI: You think I, laugh like Elmer Fudd sitting on a juicer?

JERRY: Well, first of all Elmer Fudd is one of the most beloved internationally known cartoon characters of all time. &quot;I'm going to kill that cwazy wabbit ... hahahahahaaa &quot; Come on. Not only that, a juicer is one of the healthiest ways ... (Naomi exits) it makes the juice ... it extracts the-the pulp and-and-and the vitamins, for-for long life and-and-and vitality.

[in Jerry's apartment]

JERRY: How could you leave a message like that on my machine.?

GEORGE: Well how could you just play your message in front of anybody?

JERRY: Because I didn't think anyone would leave it!

GEORGE: Well, I didn't think anyone would play it.

JERRY: Well, now she's not going away for this weekend.

GEORGE: What do you mean not goin'? Come on, we got plans here. Call her up.

JERRY: Nah, it's better anyway. I mean really. What was going to happen? I'm a comedian. How can I go out with a girl with a laugh like that? I mean izz-it's like ah, it's like Coco Chanel goin' out with a fish monger. You know, cause she's with all the perfumes and a fish monger's pretty bad smell.

GEORGE: Wh-Well maybe you should ask Elaine.

JERRY: Yeah but if I ask Elaine, then Kramer will feel slighted.

GEORGE: Oh no no no no, don't say anything to Kramer. Susan can't stand him. He vomited all over her.

JERRY: Yeah, .. wait a minute do you smell smoke?

(Kramer enters smoking a cigar)

KRAMER: Hmm.

JERRY: Ah, Kramer.

KRAMER: Hello boys, (in an Irish accent) top of the morning to ya. What do you say?

What do ya be?

JERRY: Will you put that thing out before you start another fire. You had to give him a box of cigars.

KRAMER: So, what are you guys doin' this weekend?

JERRY and GEORGE: uh uh, we're uh ..

KRAMER: Because I'm going to be playing golf at the Westchester country club. Mmh.

JERRY: Westchester? Isn't that a private club?

KRAMER: Oh, that's right buddy. It's private. It's very private. But I met the pro at the golf shop up on 49th St. -- I gave him one of these Cubans and he invites me up to play a free round ... then he says anytime I lay one of these babies on him it's going to be the same deal. Ha ha. Idn't that beautiful.

JERRY: and GEORGE: Ye, hu, um Ye,

KRAMER: Man, I'm going to be hitting the links all weekend.&nbsp; Ffoooo (Taking an imaginary swing, he makes the sound of a golf ball being hit)

GEORGE: Gee, that's-that's too bad.

JERRY: Yeah, too bad.

KRAMER: Why? What wa?

GEORGE: Well, cause we were just saying we were going to ask you to come up to the country with us this weekend.&nbsp; Susan's father has a cabin up there.&nbsp; But, eh, all right, well.

KRAMER: Well, what, they got any golf courses up there?

JERRY and GEORGE: No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

GEORGE: No, no that's ah, that's pie country.

JERRY: Yeah

GEORGE: Yeah, they eh, they do a lot of baking up there.

KRAMER: Uh huh.

(MONKS)

ELAINE: I don't know.

JERRY: Come on. I don't want to tag along with George and Susan. If you're there it'll be a better group.

ELAINE: What's that?

JERRY: Ah, it's an autographed picture for my dry cleaner. I never know what to write on these things. I hate doin' this.

ELAINE: &quot;I'm very imPRESSED&quot;? ... Ah you mean pressed caus' its like a dry cleaner?

JERRY: Yeah, see that's why I hate it. So, come on, you going to go?

ELAINE: Well what about the sleeping arrangements? In the Cabin!

JERRY: Well, um same bed ...

ELAINE: uh huh (very quietly)

JERRY: .. and uh, underwear and a tee shirt.

ELAINE: What about me?

JERRY: Well you'd be naked of course.

ELAINE: Uh, that's, ...

MEL: Excuse me, Jerry Seinfeld?

JERRY: Yeah.

MEL: My name's Sanger, Mel Sanger.

JERRY: Hi.

MEL: I drive that truck out there.

JERRY: Oh, the Yoo Hoo?

MEL: Yeah.

JERRY: I love Yoo Hoo.

MEL: Yes, it's a fine product. Anyway I saw you on the Tonight Show a couple weeks ago. I was watching the show with my son Donald. He's got this rare immune deficiency in his blood ... the damnedest thing. Doctors say he has to live in a plastic bubble. Can you imagine that? A bubble.

JERRY: A bubble?

ELAINE: A bubble?

MEL: Yes, a bubble!

MEL: Do you mind? May I?

ELAINE: Oh, sure.

(Mel sits down with them)

MEL: Ah, It'd break your heart seein' him in there. It's like a prisoner. No friends - just his mother and me. And I'm out there six days a week haulin' Yoo Hoo. We have sacrificed everything. All for the sake of our little ... bubble boy.

(breaks up in tears)

MEL: (in tears) Excuse me, I ah ...

ELAINE: Oh right here (giving out paper napkins to Mel and Jerry and herself)

(MEL AND ELAINE WIPE TEARS FROM THEIR EYES, JERRY WIPES CRUMBS FROM HIS MOUTH and picks his teeth at the corner of his mouth)

MEL: Excuse me, anyway we were watching ya on TV.

JERRY: You get in the bubble with him?

MEL: No. He can see through the bubble. It's plastic.

JERRY: Oh, I thought it was like an igloo.

MEL: No, it's clear.

JERRY: Ah ha.

ELAINE: Who has the remote?&nbsp; (wipes a tear from her eye)

MEL: He does.

ELAINE: The remote goes through the bubble?

MEL: Yeah, he's in the bubble with the remote.

JERRY: So you have no control over the remote?

MEL: No, it's frustrating.

JERRY: Mmm

ELAINE: Yeah, of course, yeah. (blows her nose)

MEL: So anyway, you're his favorite comedian. He laughed so hard the other night we had to give him an extra shot of hemoglobin.

JERRY: Awe... That's nice!

MEL: Tomorrow is his birthday and it would mean so much to him if you could find it in your heart ta' pay him a visit and, just say hello.

JERRY: Hu, well, tomorrow, I, ...

ELAINE: Jerry! Of course he'd pay him a visit. You'd be happy to.

JERRY: Yeah, uh, Ok, uh, tomorrow uh, where da ya - where do you live, uh, up town? Upper west side?

MEL: No, up state.

JERRY: Up state! Hummm.

JERRY: Yes. A bubble boy.

SUSAN: What's a bubble boy?

JERRY: He lives in a bubble.

GEORGE: Boy!

SUSAN: Say, so what kind of a bubble? Like an igloo?

JERRY: No, that's what I thought but apparently it's just a big piece of plastic dividing the room.

SUSAN: Oh.

GEORGE: What kind of plastic do you think it is? What do you think like that dry cleaning plastic?

JERRY: That's no good. He wouldn't last ten minutes in there. Anyway what can I do, I promised I'd go visit him tomorrow.&nbsp; It's his birthday. I can't go to the cabin.

SUSAN: Well, where does he live?

JERRY: I don't know, up state, Falls, somethin'

SUSAN: Wait a minute, This is right on the way to the cabin.

GEORGE: Well all right, beautiful, so you stop in. Ya, ya visit the bubble boy for twenty minutes and then we can go.

JERRY: You think we can do it?

SUSAN: Oh I know exactly where this is. You can just follow us.

JERRY: Oh, great. Ok we'll goin' away. I think I'm excited.

GEORGE: (laughs) hu hu.

SUSAN: I'm excited. Oh, you're going to love this cabin. My grandfather built it in 1947. It's it's incredible.

JERRY: Ohh.

GEORGE: All right there you go. It's a '47 cabin all right. So, we'll see you tomorrow.

JERRY: OK.

KRAMER: Well,

GEORGE: and JERRY: Very nice, very nice, nice.

(Susan recoils at his presence)

KRAMER: Well, I'm off to the links.

SUSAN: Did you ...&nbsp; (George grabs her hand)

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

(2 cars on the road George leading, Jerry following --)

(IN Jerry's car on highway)

ELAINE: Hey, what's with George and Susan? Does he actually like her?

JERRY: Ah, I don't know if he likes her as much as he likes it.?

ELAINE: Oh, that's nice!

JERRY: What's he doing? What is his hurry?

(George's car pulls away at a high rate of speed)

ELAINE: Well you know George. It's not good enough to get there. You gotta make good time.

JERRY: I know he once went from West 81st Street to Kennedy Airport in 25 minutes.

I-I never heard
