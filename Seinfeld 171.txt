						[Monk's]<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: When are they gonna learn that any news about China is an instant page-turner? (seeing Jerry with a small black device) What's that?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: It's a Wizard electronic organizer for my dad. I'm goin' to Florida for his birthday.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: How much was it?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Two hundred. But I'll tell him it's fifty. He doesn't care about the gift. He gets excited about the deal.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Where are you gettin' a Wizard for fifty dollars?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Ah, I'll tell him I got it on the street, and maybe it's hot. That's his favorite.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I got a message from the Rosses at work today.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Susan's parents? When's the last time you talked to them?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: At the funeral, give or take. You know, deep down, I always kinda felt that they blamed me for Susan's death.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Why, because you picked out the poision envelopes? That's silly.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: (entering Monk's with her boyfriend) Oh, um... Darryl. These are... people I know. Jerry, George.<br>
							<br>
							
						DARRYL: Nice meeting you. Ah, I gotta run, Elaine. I'll see you later.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: OK.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Still no Puddy?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Uh, I think his answering machine's broken, so I just gave up. Well, what do you think?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What? About you datin' a black guy? What's the big deal?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: What black guy?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Darryl. He's black, isn't he?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: He is?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: No, he isn't.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Isn't he, Elaine?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: You think?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I thought he looked Irish.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What's his last name?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Nelson.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: That's not Irish.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I think he's black.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Should we be talkin' about this?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I think it's OK.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: No, it isn't.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Why not?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Well, it would be OK if Darryl was here.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: If he's black.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Is he black?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Does it matter?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: No, course not. I mean, I'd just like to know.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Oh, so you need to know?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: No, I don't need to know. I just think it would be nice if I knew.<br>
							<br>
							
						WAITRESS: Should I take that?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (getting out his wallet) Uh, one second.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: (looking in her purse) Oh, here.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (pulling out some money) Uh, yeah. Hang on. Just... yeah.<br>
							<br>
							
						(when they see the waitress, who is black, all three hurriedly get out lots of money for her tip)<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Jerry's Apartment]<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (on the phone) Uh, Mrs. Ross? It's-it's George.<br>
							<br>
							
						MRS. ROSS: Uh, who?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: George Costanza. Susan's, uh, friend? Long time no speak.<br>
							<br>
							
						MR. ROSS: (walking by Mrs. Ross) We're all out of lime juice. I told that woman to buy more.<br>
							<br>
							
						MRS. ROSS: Uh, George, the Susan Ross Foundation is having an event this weekend.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Oh, I just, uh, leased a house out in the Hamptons, and I have got to get out there this weekend and sign the papers.<br>
							<br>
							
						MR. ROSS: (again walking by) I'm goin' back to bed.<br>
							<br>
							
						MRS. ROSS: Thank you for calling, George.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Oh, sure. I mean, after all, you were almost my, uh... OK, I gotta go.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: House in the Hamptons?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Well, you know, I've been lyin' about my income for a few years. I figured I could afford a fake house in the Hamptons.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: (enters) Well.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Hey.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Well, grab a cigar, boys. Yeah. It's time to celebrate.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Wow. What are we celebrating?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Uh, you remember my coffee table book?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: With the little legs?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: That's the one. A big Hollywood so-and-so optioned it for a movie.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: How are they gonna make that book into a movie?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: You remember that photo book on toy ray guns?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Yeah?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Independence Day?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Oh.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: How much are they payin' you?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Let's just say that I don't have to worry about working for a while. A long while.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: That's funny because I haven't seen you working for a while. A long while.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Yeah, and you're not going to, because I'm hanging it up. Boys, I'm retiring.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: From what?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: From the grind. I mean, who needs it? I mean, I've accomplished everything I've set out to do.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (seeing that Kramer has a new watch) What's that?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Oh, I bought myself a little retirement gift. Gold watch.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY &amp; GEORGE: Ooh!<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Well, it's not really gold.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY &amp; GEORGE: Aww.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Darryl's Apartment]<br>
							<br>
							
						(approaching Darryl's apartment, Elaine hears loud rap music being played, and smiles knowingly)<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: (as Darryl opens his door) Hey.<br>
							<br>
							
						DARRYL: Hey.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Great music.<br>
							<br>
							
						DARRYL: Oh, it's my neighbor. They blast that stuff twenty four hours a day. I hate it.<br>
							<br>
							
						DARRYL: Yo, you! Turn it down!<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oh, wow, these are nice. Do they have any cultural significance?<br>
							<br>
							
						DARRYL: They're... African.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Right. African.<br>
							<br>
							
						DARRYL: Well, not Africa, actually. South Africa.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: South Africa.<br>
							<br>
							
						DARRYL: My family used to live there, but, uh, we got out years ago, for obvious reasons. You know how it is.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Maybe.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Street]<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (to a street vender selling hot dogs) You must hate hot dogs, huh? Or else, you, uh, you really like 'em and that's why you, you do this.<br>
							<br>
							
						(the Rosses come out of a nearby building onto the street, observe George not being in the Hamptons, and move on)<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I'll tell ya, if I had one of these things, I'd be eatin' hot dogs all the time.<br>
							<br>
							
						VENDER: Are you gonna buy a hot dog or not?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Mmm... no.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Florida- Seinfeld Condo]<br>
							<br>
							
						MORTY: (Jerry comes out of his room, having just woken up) Rise and shine, sleepy head! Ha ha!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: It's 5:30 in the morning!<br>
							<br>
							
						HELEN: We let you sleep in.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (handing his dad a gift) Well, as long as I'm up. Dad, I got you a birthday present. Here. Happy Birthday.<br>
							<br>
							
						MORTY: Aw, Jerry. I should be buyin' you presents.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What does that mean?<br>
							<br>
							
						HELEN: Leave your father alone. It's his birthday.<br>
							<br>
							
						MORTY: Oooh! Heh heh! It's a radar detector.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Radar detector? I've never seen you go over twenty miles an hour. You're like the Grand Marshall of the Rose Bowl Parade. It's a Wizard organizer.<br>
							<br>
							
						MORTY: This looks like too much money.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Nah, I got it from a guy on the street. It was, like, fifty bucks.<br>
							<br>
							
						MORTY: You think it's hot?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Could be.<br>
							<br>
							
						MORTY: Attaboy! Helen, Jerry got me a hot Wizard computer!<br>
							<br>
							
						HELEN: I'm right here.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: And you can do everything with it. You can get e-mail, fax, there's a calculator.<br>
							<br>
							
						MORTY: So, I can use it in the restaurant to figure out the tip?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yeah, I guess. But the really cool thing is the daily planner.<br>
							<br>
							
						MORTY: Helen, we got into restaurants and figure out the tips.<br>
							<br>
							
						HELEN: Jerry, you're getting your father too excited.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: (entering the condo, and going to the fridge as if he's a neighbor) Hey, buddy. When'd you get here?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Kramer, what are you doing here?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: I told you I was retiring. I moved in next door.<br>
							<br>
							
						HELEN: Mr. Kornstein died, and it's a beautiful apartment.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Yeah, your, uh, folks said it was for rent, so I jumped on it.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Kramer, you can't live down here. This is where people come to die.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (getting looks from his parents) Not you. Older people.<br>
							<br>
							
						HELEN: Don't eat cookies for breakfast! I'll fix you something. How 'bout a feta cheese omelette?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Mmmm, that sounds great, Mom.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: If you feed him, he'll never leave.<br>
							<br>
							
						HELEN: We don't have any feta. How about cottage cheese and Egg Beaters?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: (immaturely) I guess.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I can't believe this.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: I know, I know. Don't I look more relaxed?<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Monk's]<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: So, George, do you have any thoughts on this Darryl situation?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Actually, I did have a thought.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oh.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Why don't you just ask him?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: (rudely and giving him a 'duh' look) Because, if I ask him, then it's like I really want to know.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Maybe he's, um... mixed.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Is that the right word?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I really don't think we're supposed to be talkin' about this.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Yeah.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (standing up) I'm just gonna go to the bathroom.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: (starting to leave) You know what, I'm leavin'.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Yeah.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I'll just talk to Jerry when he gets back. (seeing the Rosses entering Monk's) Oh. Mrs. Ross, Mr. Ross.<br>
							<br>
							
						MRS. ROSS: Oh, you're George's friend.<br>
							<br>
							
						MR. ROSS: We saw him in the city this weekend. Uh, what happened to his place in the Hamptons?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: (laughing uproariously) The Hamptons? George Costanza? I, uh... I don't think so. Have a good one.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Rosses.<br>
							<br>
							
						MR. ROSS: George, we were just talking about you.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Well, sorry I missed that, uh, charity thing. But this was one of those truly glorious Hampton weekends that you always hear about.<br>
							<br>
							
						MRS. ROSS: Really?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Yeah, I may move out there. (getting 'yeah, right' glances from the Rosses) I mean it, I'll do it! OK, I'll see ya later. Keep it real!<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Florida- Restaurant]<br>
							<br>
							
						MORTY: (eating lunch with Helen and Jerry) Another fine meal, and now for my Wizard tip calculator.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Dad, it's got lots of other functions.<br>
							<br>
							
						MORTY: Don't worry. I'll get to the other functions. (trying to open it) I can't get it open.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Jerry easily opens it)<br>
							<br>
							
						HELEN: Yay! Jerry got it open.<br>
							<br>
							
						MORTY: The service was slow. And God forbid they should refill the water. How does 12.4% sound?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (looking at the Wizard) Well, your tip is four dollars and thirty-six point six six six six cents.<br>
							<br>
							
						MORTY: We'll round down.<br>
							<br>
							
						HELEN: Jerry, it was so nice of you to come down here on your father's birthday. You've helped take his mind off the condo elections.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Oh, right. You can't run for condo president because you were impeached at the other condo.<br>
							<br>
							
						MORTY: I was never impeached! I resigned!<br>
							<br>
							
						HELEN: Even so, the press would bury him!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: What press?<br>
							<br>
							
						HELEN: The condo newsletter, the Boca Breeze.<br>
							<br>
							
						MORTY: Pinko Commie rag.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Florida- clubhouse]<br>
							<br>
							
						OLD MAN: (coming up to the three Seinfelds) Hey, Morty. Your boy here, he just got a date with that young aquacise instructor.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: She's fifty.<br>
							<br>
							
						OLD MAN: You know what he's got? He's got charisma. That's my man.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: All right, I'll see you guys.<br>
							<br>
							
						OLD MAN: Yeah.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Yeah.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer, scanning the scene, is surprised to see Morty, right next to him, staring at his face)<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: (taping Morty's glasses) Morty, what're you lookin' at?<br>
							<br>
							
						MORTY: I'll tell you what I'm looking at: the next condo president of Del Boca Vista, Phase Three.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Hmm.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Darryl's Apartment]<br>
							<br>
							
						DARRYL: Elaine, thank you for the Wizard!<br>
							<br>
							
						(Elaine laughts somewhat awkwardly)<br>
							<br>
							
						DARRYL: Wow, it's got so many functions.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Yeah, yeah. Forget about all that. First thing is first. Warranty information. Name, we know that. Uh, hobbies. Skiing, racquetball...<br>
							<br>
							
						DARRYL: Well, I don't do that stuff.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter. Um. Oh, here's one: race.<br>
							<br>
							
						DARRYL: Isn't that optional?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: It certainly should be. It's nobody's damn business! But they really would like to know.<br>
							<br>
							
						DARRYL: All right, I'm... Asian.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: What?<br>
							<br>
							
						DARRYL: Just to mess with 'em.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: laughing awkwardly: Oh. Right. Good one.<br>
							<br>
							
						DARRYL: Average income, uh... over a hundred thousand.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Really?<br>
							<br>
							
						DARRYL: Does that matter?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: No, but... it is very nice to know.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Florida- Seinfeld Condo]<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (in his parent's condo, on the phone with Elaine) So did you figure out Darryl's... you know.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: (in Jerry's apartment) Ah, I've given up. So, now we're going to a bunch of Spanish restaurants. I figure that'll cover us either way.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (as Kramer walks by) You're a master of race relations.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Hey, so Kramer's running for president of the condo?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Yeah, it's all my father's doing.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Kramer, apparently looking for something to do, mumbles to Jerry to hand him a magazine from the table)<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: He wants to install Kramer in a puppet regime and then wield power from behind the scenes. Preferably from the sauna in the clubhouse.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oh, heh heh heh. Who are they running against?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Common sense and a guy in a wheelchair.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (entering Jerry's apartment) Jerry?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: (to George) He's still down with his folks.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (to Elaine) What are you doin' here?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (overhearing the other two: Elaine, Elaine--<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: (to George) I'm gettin' his mail.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (overhearing the other two) Oh, no.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (to Elaine) He asked you to get the mail?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: (to George) Mm-hmm.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (taking the phone from Elaine) Jerry, why is Elaine getting your mail?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: George, listen to me. I have a very important job for you. I want you to come by twice a day and flush the toilet so the gaskets don't dry out and leak.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: (trying to understand what they're talking about) What?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: What about the mail?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: This is far more important. You must exercise the gaskets, George.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (hanging up) All right, Jerry. I'll do it. See ya.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Jerry's apartment]<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: So, I ran into the Rosses again.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Oh, right, at the coffee shop. Where did they get the idea that you have a place in the Hamptons?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: From me.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: What did you say?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: I told them I have a place in the Hamptons. What did you say?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I told them you didn't. And I laughed and I laughed.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: So, they knew? Those liars!<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: But you lied first.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Yeah, but they let me go on and on all about the Hamptons, they never said a thing! You don't let somebody lie when they know you're lying. You call them a liar!<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Like you're a liar!<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Yes. Thank you! Is that so hard?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: So, this is over, not over? I'm bettin', not over.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Hmm-hmm, not by a long shot. I'm calling up the Rosses and inviting them up to my non-existent place in the Hamptons. Then we'll see who blinks first.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Haven't you done enough to these people?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: This is not about them. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to exercise Jerry's gaskets.<br>
							<br>
							
						(Elaine gets a sarcastic, 'oh, boy' expression)<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Florida- Kramer Campaigning]<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: (to a room) Vote for Kramer. (to a man walking by) Cosmo Kramer. I'm running for condo president. I'd like your vote. Thanks. (to an old woman) Remember, ma'am, a vote for me, is a vote for Kramer.<br>
							<br>
							
						OLD WOMAN: Will you cut my meat?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Gladly.<br>
							<br>

						DARRYL: Sure.<br>
							<br>
							
						WAITRESS: (to Darryl) Are you black? Or should I bring some cream.<br>
							<br>
							
						DARRYL: I'm black. (re-thinking) Oh, you know what? Bring a little cream. (seeing a couple gesturing towards him and Elaine) Did you hear that?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: What?<br>
							<br>
							
						DARRYL: God, there are still people who have trouble with an interracial couple.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Interracial? Us?<br>
							<br>
							
						DARRYL: Isn't that unbelievable!?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Yes, it's awful! They're upset because we're an interracial couple. That is racism!<br>
							<br>
							
						DARRYL: I don't feel like eating.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: Me neither. Well, maybe this turkey club.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							
						[Outside the Ross']<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: So... here I am. Ready to take you to the Hamptons.<br>

						GEORGE: Do you have your bathing suits?<br>
							<br>
							
						MR. ROSS: It's March.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Speak now, or we are headed to the Hamptons. It's a two-hour drive. Once you get in that car, we are going all the way... to the Hamptons. All right, you wanna get nuts? Come on. Let's get nuts!<br>

						[Florida-Seinfeld Condo]<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: (in his parent's condo, to his father, who's in another room) Hey, Dad. You know you can program this thing to beep every time you need to take a vitamin. (as Kramer comes walking out in a retirement-like athletic sweatsuit) Dad, you look so different.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Oh, no. We're campaigning, Jerry. To rule the people, one... must walk among them.<br>
							<br>
							
						MORTY: (coming into the hall) This is the home stretch. Tomorrow's the election!<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Right. Yeah. The polls close after dinner, three o'clock. But then when we win, the celebration goes all night until the break of eight p.m.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: You know, you can put that whole schedule right in your daily planner.<br>
							<br>
							
						MORTY: Daily what?<br>
							<br>
							
						HELEN: (coming into the condo) Have you read today's Boca Breeze?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: (looking at the newsletter) Hey, look at that. Picture of me, huh? (reading out loud) Candidate Cosmo Kramer caught barefoot in clubhouse.<br>
							<br>
							
						MORTY: Barefoot in the clubhouse? Don't you realize this is against the rules.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Well, I couldn't find my shoes.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Kramer, these people work and wait their whole lives to move down here, sit in the heat, pretend it's not hot, and enforce these rules.<br>
							<br>
							
						HELEN: Who wants hot chocolate?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Oh, yeah! Me.<br>
							<br>
							
						MORTY: This is a huge scandal! We need damage control.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: All right, look. People seem to like those tip calculators, huh?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Wizards!<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Yeah, well, how 'bout if we give one out to every member on the condo board.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Kramer...<br>
							<br>
							
						MORTY: There are twenty people on the board. Thank God you can get that deal.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Payoffs. Now we're playin' politics. All right, what do we next, Morty, huh? Wiretaps, slush funds?<br>
							<br>
							
						MORTY: (rushing to his bedroom) First, I need a nap.<br>
							<br>
							
						HELEN: (running after him) Oh, I'll get your electric blanket!<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Kramer, I can't get that many Wizards.<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Well, what about your deal, huh?<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: I didn't have a deal! They're two hundred dollars a pop. What do I do?<br>
							<br>
							
						KRAMER: Well, don't worry about it. I know a guy.<br>
							<br>
							
						JERRY: Down here?<br>

						George, driving in the car with the Rosses) And that leads into the master bedroom.<br>

						MRS. ROSS: Tell us more.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: You want to hear more? The master bedroom opens into the solarium.<br>
							<br>
							
						MR. ROSS: Another solarium?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Yes, two solariums. Quite a find. And I have horses, too?<br>
							<br>
							
						MR. ROSS: What are their names?<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: Snoopy and Prickly Pete. Should I keep driving?<br>
							<br>
							
						MRS. ROSS: Oh, look, an antique stand. Pull over. We'll buy you a housewarming gift.<br>
							<br>
							
						GEORGE: (chuckling to himself) Housewarming gift. (swerving the car to go to the antique stand) All right, we're taking it up a notch!<br>

						WAITRESS: (leaving) I'll give you a couple minutes to decide.<br>
							<br>
							
						DARRYL: What are you talking about?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: You're black. You said we were an interracial couple.<br>
							<br>
							
						DARRYL: We are. Because you're Hispanic.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I am?<br>
							<br>
							
						DARRYL: Aren't you?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: No. Why would you think that?<br>
							<br>
							
						DARRYL: Your name's Benes, your hair, and you kept taking me to those Spanish restaurants.<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: That's because I thought you were black.<br>
							<br>
							
						DARRYL: Why would you take me to a Spanish restaurant because I'm black?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I don't think we should be talking about this.<br>
							<br>
							
						DARRYL: So, what are you?<br>
							<br>
							
						ELAINE: I'm white.<br>
							<br>
							
						DARRYL: So, we're just a couple of white people?<br>
