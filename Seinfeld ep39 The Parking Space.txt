[Opening monologue]

At parking lots now they have these 'compact car only' spots, isn't that discrimination against the size of your car? If I want my ass hanging out of the back of my parking spot, that's my business. There are people out there with real asses hanging out of their pants, nobody's stopping them. Nobody goes, &quot;Hey, hold it, sir. Those are compact jeans, you can't pull that in there.&quot;


[Jerry is in his apartment, Kramer enters.]

KRAMER: Hey. I got some bad news for you, buddy. I think your car got stolen again.

JERRY: What are you talking about?

KRAMER: Well you parked it on eighty-fourth and Columbus, right?

JERRY: Yeah.

KRAMER: Yep, well I just walked by there and that car is gone.

JERRY: Oh yeah, I know.

KRAMER: Well, where is it?

JERRY: What's the difference?

KRAMER: Well, there's no difference, you know, I'm just curious.

JERRY: You always have to know everything that's going on, don't you?

KRAMER: What happened to the car?

JERRY: If I don't tell you it will kill you, won't it?

KRAMER: Yeah, yeah, it'll kill me.

JERRY: You have to know, you must know.

KRAMER: I must know.

JERRY: Well, I'm not telling you.

KRAMER: Oh, come on.

JERRY: Nope. I don't think so.

KRAMER: Well, please?

JERRY: Not today, pal.

KRAMER: Okay, I beg you.

JERRY: Now see? Just saying beg doesn't make it a real beg. You gotta put some beg into it.

KRAMER: Okay, please! Please tell me!

JERRY: Alright, I'll tell you, but your begging needs a lot of work.

KRAMER: Okay, okay, what is it? Come on.

JERRY: I loaned the car to George.

KRAMER: Ah, George, alright. Well, what for?

JERRY: George and Elaine went to a flea market in Westchester, okay?!

KRAMER: Alright.

JERRY: Huh?

KRAMER: Huh. I mean, what do they want to go there for?

JERRY: Will you stop it already?!

KRAMER: You know, why didn't they ask me to go?

JERRY: I don't know! How am I supposed to know?!

KRAMER: What, they don't like me?

JERRY: *I* don't like you!

KRAMER: If they like me, why don't they ask me to go? Oh yeah.


[George and Elaine are in Jerry's car. George is wearing a new hat.]

GEORGE: I really think it looks good.

ELAINE: Ten bucks, how can you go wrong?

GEORGE: All bald people look good in hats.

ELAINE: You should have lived in the twenties and thirties, you know men wore hats all the time then.

GEORGE: What a bald paradise that must have been. Nobody knew.

ELAINE: Well, you can wear a hat all the time now. Who's stopping you?

GEORGE: No, I can't. What if I meet a woman? I'd always be worried about that first moment where I'd take it off and see that look of disappointment on her face.

ELAINE: Are you sure you like these sunglasses?

Elaine moves the rear view mirror so she can check out her sunglasses and this causes George to swerve and hit something.


[Cut back to Kramer and Jerry at Jerry's apartment.]

KRAMER: Well I'm very disappointed in George and Elaine. And you know I'm somebody you don't want to have on your bad side.

JERRY: Why not?

KRAMER: Because I'm like ice, buddy. When I don't like you, you've got problems. (notices some snacks on the table) Oh, is this for the fight?

JERRY: Yep. (checks watch) Starts in thirty-five minutes.

(Kramer and Jerry start 'sparring'.)

KRAMER: Oh hey, you know I invited Mike Moffit. You don't mind, do you?

JERRY: No, I like Mike.

KRAMER: Yeah, I just got off the phone with him, you know we had a great conversation.

JERRY: Oh yeah? What did you talk about?

KRAMER: Well actually we talked about you. Yeah. He had some pretty interesting things to say.

JERRY: Oh yeah? What did he say?

KRAMER: You have to know everything, don't you?

JERRY: No, come on, Kramer. What did he say?

KRAMER: Why is that? Why do you have to know everything?

JERRY: Kramer, just tell me what the guy said.

KRAMER: Beg me.

JERRY: Please, don't make me beg.

KRAMER: No no no, I want you to beg me. And I don't want you to say it, I just want you to put some beg into it. Go on.

JERRY: Kramer, please tell me what the guy said.

KRAMER: No no no, that's no good. No, I really don't think that's a beg. No, it's close, but uh...

JERRY: Kramer!

KRAMER: Look, I can't say anything. You know, the guy told me the stuff in confidence, I'd be betraying a friend.

JERRY: Well you can't just mention it and then not tell me.

KRAMER: Alright. I'll tell you but you can't say anything to him.

JERRY: I'm not saying anything, I'm putting it in the vault, I'm locking the vault, it's a vault!

KRAMER: He thinks you're a phony.

JERRY: He what?

KRAMER: I told you, he thinks you're a phony.

JERRY: A phony? He called me a phony?

KRAMER: A big phone. A big one.

JERRY: Why did you tell me that if I can't say anything?!

KRAMER: You begged me.


[Cut back to Elaine and George in Jerry's car, the car is now making a clanking noise.]

GEORGE: Do you hear that?

ELAINE: Of course I hear that.

GEORGE: You had to move the mirror?

ELAINE: I wanted to check out my sunglasses.

GEORGE: I went to look in the mirror, it wasn't there. You threw off my equilibrium.

ELAINE: Oh yeah, blame it on me because you can't drive, George.

GEORGE: I can't drive?

ELAINE: Yeah.

GEORGE: Nobody drives like me. Nobody. I'm doing things in this car, you have no idea they're going on. Wanna see me make a right turn from the left lane? Watch this.

ELAINE: No, I really don't.

GEORGE: And I can make a left turn from the right lane too.

ELAINE: I'm sure you could.

GEORGE: What are we gonna tell Jerry about the car?

ELAINE: I don't know.

GEORGE: Alright, start looking for spaces.

ELAINE: Oh, you're never gonna find a space on Jerry's block, just put it in a garage.

GEORGE: Look, I have my system. First I look for the dream spot right in front of the door, then I slowly expand out in concentric circles.

ELAINE: Oh come on, George, please put it in a garage. I don't want to spend an hour looking for a space.

GEORGE: I can't park in a garage.

ELAINE: Why?

GEORGE: I don't know, I just can't. Nobody in my family can pay for parking, it's a sickness. My father never paid for parking; my mother, my brother, nobody. We can't do it.

ELAINE: I'll pay for it.

GEORGE: You don't understand. A garage. I can't even pull in there. It's like going to a prostitute. Why should I pay, when if I apply myself, maybe I could get it for free? (he hears a horn honking) What? What do you want? Go around me, I'm looking for spaces.

ELAINE: (pointing backwards) Oh George, there's a space right there!

GEORGE: (putting the car in reverse) Oh beautiful! Look at that, the dream space right in front of Jerry's building. Huh? Dreams can come true, what did I tell you?

ELAINE: You didn't even have to take it out to dinner.

(They share a laugh.)

GEORGE: Alright, now you're gonna see some parallel parking. (spitting into his hands and rubbing them together) How I wish you could make a living parallel parking. (turning around in his seat) It's all geometry, knowing all the angles, when to make that first turn and then when to swing it back in, that's the key.

ELAINE: Will you just park it already?

GEORGE: There's nothing I can even impart to you, that's the sad thing. It's so inborn, I can't pass it on. (begins backing into the space) Look at this guy. Are you crazy, what are you doing?! Hey! Hey, you're stealing my space!

ELAINE: George, wait, you don't know who this guy is, people kill for a parking space in this city.

GEORGE: No no no, he's not getting away with this.

ELAINE: George?

(George gets out of the car to confront the other driver.)

GEORGE: Hey, what are you doing?

MIKE: I think I'm parking my car.

GEORGE: You can't do that, you can't just sneak in from the back like that.

MIKE: I'm not sneaking. I didn't even know you were parking, you were just sitting there three spaces up.

GEORGE: Well if you didn't think I was parking, why did you put it in head first?

MIKE: Well that's the way I park. Anyway, you didn't start backing in until I pulled in.

GEORGE: I was in the middle of a conversation.

MIKE: Hey, buddy, what can I tell you?

GEORGE: The point is I was here first.

MIKE: I was closer to this space than you were.

GEORGE: But I'm backing in! You can't put it in head first!

MIKE: I can if I have room!

GEORGE: Are you gonna move the car?

MIKE: No, I'm not gonna move the car.

GEORGE: Jerk!

MIKE: Oh, you're not?

GEORGE: Do you believe this guy?

ELAINE: Come on, we'll put it in a garage.

GEORGE: I am not putting it in a garage, it's my space.

ELAINE: What are you gonna do, you just gonna leave it here like this? Uh. I'm going upstairs.

GEORGE: Are you coming back down?

ELAINE: Yeah, I gotta tell Jerry we're here. I gotta go to the bathroom.

GEORGE: Alright, just make sure he reserves the good chair for me. Wait, what are you gonna tell him about the clanking noise in the car?

ELAINE: Me? No no no, you. You're gonna tell him. I'm not gonna tell- Noo.

GEORGE: Oh, come on, you're good at this.

ELAINE: What am I gonna say?

GEORGE: I don't know, I don't know, you'll think of something.

(Elaine heads upstairs. Mike honks his horn, George honks his in retaliation.)


[Cut to Jerry's apartment. Jerry is moving chairs, Elaine bursts in.]

ELAINE: Oh god, I need a drink, do you got any Hennigan's here?

JERRY: Yeah, under the counter. What happened?

ELAINE: Oh god. Oh, Jerry it was so terrible what we just went through on the way home. (pouring a big shot of scotch) You wouldn't believe it. (pushing a bag of chips off the counter)

JERRY: (bending down to pick up the chips) Tell me what happened.

ELAINE: (after pouring the shot in the sink while Jerry was distracted and pretending to have downed it) Okay. Now listen. We were at the toll booth at the Henry Hudson Parkway, okay?! And there were these, like, this pack of extremely wild teenagers in a convertible behind us, okay?! And for some reason, I don't know, they just started to taunt us! And so then we payed the toll, and then we went through, and then they started to follow us, alright?! So George tries to lose them, and, and, but they were in this really like a souped up car, you know?! And so he turned off the road really suddenly and the car was on two wheels and I was just screaming! And then, George is such a great driver.

JERRY: He is?

ELAINE: Oh, he is fantastic! And then they fired a gun right up in the air.

JERRY: A gun?!

ELAINE: I think it was a gun. And then they followed us all the way into the city, and then they just stopped and they turned around and they went home.

JERRY: My god, are you okay?

ELAINE: Yeah, yeah, I'm alright. Oh, by the way, the car hit a pothole and now it's making a clanking noise.

JERRY: Well, I mean, as long as you're okay, that, that's the important thing.

ELAINE: Exactly.

JERRY: Where's George now?

ELAINE: Oh, he's out in front of the building. He's arguing with some guy about a parking space.

JERRY: What are you talking about?

ELAINE: Look out the window, you'll see.

JERRY: (leaning out the window) Hey Georgie!

GEORGE: Hey!

JERRY: Are you okay?

GEORGE: Yeah, I'm fine.

JERRY: Crazy kids, huh?

GEORGE: What?

ELAINE: (desperate to distract Jerry) Ow!! (Jerry looks over) It's my cuticle.

MIKE: Is that Jerry? Jerry?!

JERRY: Oh, hey Mike.

GEORGE: What, you know Jerry?

MIKE: Yeah, I know Jerry.

GEORGE: How do you know him?

MIKE: What's the difference?

GEORGE: Because I know him too, and probably a lot better than you.

MIKE: Well, bully for you. Hey, Jerry! You know your friend here's a real piece of work!

JERRY: I'm coming down.

MIKE: Hey, will you tell Kramer I'm outside?

GEORGE: What, you know Kramer?!

(Kramer walks into Jerry's apartment.)

ELAINE: Hi.

KRAMER: (acting standoffish) Hello.

JERRY: Hey, your friend Mike's outside, he wants to talk to you.

KRAMER: (out the window) Hey, Mike! Come on up, the fight's almost starting!

GEORGE: And you're watching the fight at Jerry's?

MIKE: Yeah.

GEORGE: Oh great.

ELAINE: You know that guy downstairs?

JERRY: Yeah, he's a real phony.

KRAMER: What's going on?!

MIKE: Hey, will you come on down? This guy's in my space!

GEORGE: It's my space!

KRAMER: I'll be down in a minute.

ELAINE: Are you going down?

KRAMER: Yeah.

ELAINE: Is anything wrong?

KRAMER: (leaving) Why should anything be wrong?

ELAINE: (heading for the bathroom) Be down in a minute.

(Jerry grabs his jacket and walks out the door.)

MIKE: Hey pal, you're not getting that space. I mean, I'll sleep in my car if I have to.

GEORGE: I'll die out here.

(Two bystanders are discussing the incident. )

BYSTANDER #1: He was down there. Once he passed his front bumper, it's no longer his space.

BYSTANDER #2: No, it doesn't matter. He was-

MIKE: Hey! Jerry! Long time no see!

JERRY: Hi Mike. (Noticing George's fedora) Indiana.

MIKE: Hey Krame! You know this guy?

KRAMER: Yeah, yeah, I know him.

MIKE: (to Jerry) You're looking tremendous. What are you on some kind of regimen?

JERRY: Yeah, twenty-five percent bran flakes. The forty percent was too much so I found a store to mix it up special for me, they take it down another fifteen percent.

MIKE: (laughing way too loud and hard) Ha ha ha ha!!! That's killer! Killer! I love that! Ha ha ha!!! You gotta use that, that's a definite!! Ha ha ha!!!

GEORGE: Oh, come on.

MIKE: Hey! Your friend here has some real problems.

GEORGE: Me? You see what he did here, you see how he tried to sneak into my space?

MIKE: Hey, just 'cause I went in front first doesn't mean I'm sneaking in.

GEORGE: You only went in front first 'cause you saw me backing up and you didn't have room to parallel park!

MIKE: I only went in front first 'cause I could make it in front first and if you pull out I'll show you!

GEORGE: You've got a prayer.

KRAMER: I go in front first all the time.

JERRY: Front first, that's how you park when you're pulling a bank job.

(Elaine shows up and pulls George aside.)

GEORGE: Did you talk to him?

ELAINE: Yeah, it's all taken care of.

GEORGE: You told him? What did you tell him?

ELAINE: I did a number on him, it was a thing of beauty, you really had to have been there to appreciate it.

GEORGE: I don't believe it, what did you say?

ELAINE: I told him a pack of teenagers in a convertible were terrorizing us and they followed us into the city.

GEORGE: A pack of teenagers?

ELAINE: Yeah, by the time I got to 

The End
