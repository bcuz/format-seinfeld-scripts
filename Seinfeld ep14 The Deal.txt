[Opening Monologue]

I've been watching women in the department stores. They're trying on clothes, and I've noticed that they do it differently from men. Women don't try on the clothes, they get behind the clothes, you see? They take a dress off the rack, and they hold it up against themself. They can tell something from this. They stick one leg way out 'cause they nedd to know, if some day I'm one-legged, and at a fourty-five degree angle, what am I gonna wear? You never see a man do that. You never see a guy take a suit off the rack, put his head in the neck, and go, &quot;What do you think about this suit? I think I'll get it. Yeah, it looks fine. Put some shoes by the bottom of the pants, I wanna make sure. Yeah, perfect. And what if I'm walking? Move the shoes, move the shoes, move the shoes, move the shoes.


[While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.]

JERRY: What are you doing? All right, all right. What's the matter with that? What about that one?

ELAINE: Robert Vaughn, The Helsinki Formula?

JERRY: He was good in Man From Uncle.

ELAINE: Guess whose birthday's comin' up soon?

JERRY: I know, I'm having my root canal the same week.

ELAINE: Oh, right. I hope you have a good oral surgeon because that can be very serious. (Changes channel) Hey, look at naked people.

JERRY: No, I don't wanna see the naked people.

ELAINE: Been a while?

JERRY: I have a vague recollection of doing something with someone, but it was a long, long time ago.

ELAINE: I think my last time was in Rochester. My hair was a lot shorter.

JERRY: I remember that it's a good thing. Someday, I hope to do it again. (Jerry looks at Elaine)

ELAINE: What?

JERRY: What?

ELAINE: What was that look?

JERRY: What look?

ELAINE: The look you just gave me.

JERRY: I gave a look?

ELAINE: Yes.

JERRY: What kind of look?

ELAINE: I know that look.

JERRY: Then what was it?

ELAINE: Why should I tell you?

JERRY: Well, you're the big look expert. I wanna see how smart you are.

ELAINE: Trust me. I know the look. (Pause) So...

JERRY: What?

ELAINE: What about the look?

JERRY: I don't know.

ELAINE: You got something on your mind?

JERRY: No. Things pop into your head. You?

ELAINE: Things occur to me from time to time.

JERRY: Yeah, me too. Well, you can't expect to just forget the past completely.

ELAINE: No, of course not.

JERRY: I mean, it was something we did. Probably about, what? Twenty-five times?

ELAINE: Thirty-seven.

JERRY: Yeah, we pretty much know what we're doin' in there. (Points to bedroom)

ELAINE: We know the terrain.

JERRY: No big surprises.

ELAINE: Nope.

JERRY: What do you think?

ELAINE: I don't know. What do you think?

JERRY: Well, it's something to consider.

ELAINE: Yeah.

JERRY: I mean, let's say we did.

ELAINE: What if.

JERRY: Is that like
